Widespread public uptake of the vaccine is crucial to stem the pandemic. Objective To examine the factors associated with survey participants' self-reported likelihood of selecting and receiving a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine. Design, Setting, and Participants A survey study of a nonprobability convenience sample of 2000 recruited participants including a choice-based conjoint analysis was conducted to estimate respondents' probability of choosing a vaccine and willingness to receive vaccination. Participants were asked to evaluate their willingness to receive each hypothetical vaccine individually. The survey presented respondents with 5 choice tasks. In each, participants evaluated 2 hypothetical COVID-19 vaccines and were asked whether they would choose vaccine A, vaccine B, or neither vaccine. Vaccine attributes included efficacy, protection duration, major adverse effects, minor adverse effects, US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval process, national origin of vaccine, and endorsement. Levels of each attribute for each vaccine were randomly assigned, and attribute order was randomized across participants. Survey data were collected on July 9, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures Average marginal component effect sizes and marginal means were calculated to estimate the relationship between each vaccine attribute level and the probability of the respondent choosing a vaccine and self-reported willingness to receive vaccination. Results A total of 1971 US adults responded to the survey (median age, 43 [interquartile range, 30-58] years); 999 (51%) were women, 1432 (73%) White, 277 (14%) were Black, and 190 (10%) were Latinx. An increase in efficacy from 50% to 70% was associated with a higher probability of choosing a vaccine (coefficient, 0.07; 95% CI, 0.06-0.09), and an increase from 50% to 90% was associated with a higher probability of choosing a vaccine (coefficient, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.15-0.18). An increase in protection duration from 1 to 5 years was associated with a higher probability of choosing a vaccine (coefficient, 0.05 95% CI, 0.04-0.07). A decrease in the incidence of major adverse effects from 1 in 10000 to 1 in 1000000 was associated with a higher probability of choosing a vaccine (coefficient, 0.07; 95% CI, 0.05-0.08). An FDA emergency use authorization was associated with a lower probability of choosing a vaccine (coefficient, -0.03; 95% CI, -0.04 to -0.01) compared with full FDA approval. A vaccine that originated from a non-US country was associated with a lower probability of choosing a vaccine (China: -0.13 [95% CI, -0.15 to -0.11]; UK: -0.04 [95% CI, -0.06 to -0.02]). Endorsements from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (coefficient, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.07-0.11) and the World Health Organization (coefficient, 0.06; 95% CI, 0.04-0.08), compared with an endorsement from President Trump were associated with higher probabilities of choosing a vaccine. Analyses of participants' willingness to receive each vaccine when assessed individually yielded similar results. An increase in efficacy from 50% to 90% was associated with a 10% higher marginal mean willingness to receive a vaccine (from 0.51 to 0.61). A reduction in the incidence of major side effects was associated with a 4% higher marginal mean willingness to receive a vaccine (from 0.54 to 0.58). A vaccine originating in China was associated with a 10% lower willingness to receive a vaccine vs one developed in the US (from 0.60 to 0.50) Endorsements from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and World Health Organization were associated with increases in willingness to receive a vaccine (7% and 6%, respectively) from a baseline endorsement by President Trump (from 0.52 to 0.59 and from 0.52 to 0.58, respectively). Conclusions and Relevance In this survey study of US adults, vaccine-related attributes and political characteristics were associated with self-reported preferences for choosing a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine and self-reported willingness to receive vaccination. These results may help inform public health campaigns to address vaccine hesitancy when a COVID-19 vaccine becomes available. This survey study evaluates the factors associated with US adults' choice of and willingness to accept a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine. Question What factors are associated with US adults' choice of and willingness to accept a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine? Findings In this survey study of a national sample of 1971 US adults, vaccine-related attributes (eg, vaccine efficacy, adverse effects, and protection duration) and political factors (eg, US Food and Drug Administration approval process, national origin of vaccine, and endorsements) were associated with preferences for choosing a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine. Health care attitudes and practices, political partisanship, and demographic characteristics, including age, sex, and race/ethnicity, were also associated with willingness to receive a vaccination.

This study aimed to explore the prevalence and associated factors of the COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in a sample of the general population in Iraqi Kurdistan. The general population with both genders with different educational levels and sociodemographic characteristics from the Duhok governorate was eligible to participate in this cross-sectional study in 2021.

During May 2020, the authors examined intended vaccination in the next 12 months in relationship to demographic variables, healthcare attitudes, and personal COVID-19 experiences for two samples of adults-those who did not receive influenza vaccine during the prior 12 months, and those who did. Methods: In May 2020, a cross-sectional online survey was conducted with a national US sample. Participants reported prior influenza vaccination (yes/no during prior 12 months) and anticipated vaccination (yes/no during next 12 months). Covariates included demographic characteristics (e.g., gender, race-ethnicity, political ideology), general beliefs (e.g., benefits of vaccines, altruistic attitudes), and COVID-19 health beliefs and experiences (COVID-19 worry and severity, perception of COVID-19 as a community threat, knowing someone with COVID-19). For each group, hierarchical multivariable logistic regression was conducted with intent to vaccinate as the outcome. Results: Among participants (n = 3502), 47% did not receive influenza vaccine in the prior 12 months and 53% had; 25.5% of non-vaccinators and 91.9% of vaccinators intended future vaccination. For nonvaccinators, odds of intending vaccination was associated with race/ethnicity (Hispanics were more likely to intend than white-NH; AOR = 1.74; 95% CI = 1.23-2.4), greater perceived benefits of vaccination (AOR = 2.19; 95% CI = 1.88-2.54), and perception of COVID-19 as a community threat (AOR = 1.91; 95% CI = 1.49-2.45). For vaccinators, odds of intending vaccination was associated with age (AOR = 1.04; 95% CI = 1.03-1.05), race/ethnicity (Black-NH and Other-NH were less likely to intend than white-NH, AOR = 0.60; 95% CI = 0.36-0.999; and AOR = 0.45; 95% CI = 0.24-0.84, respectively), greater perceived benefits of vaccination (AOR = 1.88; 95% CI = 1.45-2.45) and greater perception of collective benefits of vaccines (AOR = 1.48; 95% CI = 1.15-1.90). Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic may have served as a cue to action for influenza vaccination intention among some prior non-vaccinators whereas intention among prior vaccinators is more related to positive attitudes toward vaccination.

Design Single-profile discrete-choice experiment. Respondents in three random blocks chose between accepting or rejecting eight hypothetical COVID-19 vaccination scenarios. Setting 4346 healthcare and welfare sector workers in France, recruited through nation-wide snowball sampling, December 2020 to January 2021. Outcome The primary outcomes were the effects of attributes' levels on hypothetical acceptance, expressed as ORs relative to the reference level. The secondary outcome was vaccine eagerness as certainty of decision, ranging from -10 to +10. Results Among all participants, 61.1% made uniform decisions, including 17.2% always refusing vaccination across all scenarios (serial non-demanders). Among 1691 respondents making variable decisions, a strong negative impact on acceptance was observed with 50% vaccine efficacy (compared with 90% efficacy: OR 0.05, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.06) and the mention of a positive benefit-risk balance (compared with absence of severe and frequent side effects: OR 0.40, 0.34 to 0.46). The highest positive impact was the prospect of safely meeting older people and contributing to epidemic control (compared with no indirect protection: OR 4.10, 3.49 to 4.82 and 2.87, 2.34 to 3.50, respectively). Predicted acceptance was 93.8% for optimised communication on messenger RNA vaccines and 16.0% for vector-based vaccines recommended to >= 55-year-old persons. Vaccine eagerness among serial non-demanders slightly but significantly increased with the prospect of safely meeting older people and epidemic control and reduced with lower vaccine efficacy.

To date, the cases due to this disease are increasing exponentially, but there is no vaccine of COVID-19 available commercially. However, several antiviral therapies are used to treat the mild symptoms of COVID-19 disease. Still, it is quite complicated and uncertain decision to choose the best antiviral therapy to treat the mild symptom of COVID-19. Hesitant Fuzzy Sets (HFSs) are proven effective and valuable structures to express uncertain information in real-world issues. Therefore, here we used the hesitant fuzzy decision-making (DM) method. This study has chosen five methods or medicines to treat the mild symptom of COVID-19. These alternatives have been ranked by seven criteria for choosing an optimal method. The purpose of this study is to develop an innovative Additive Ratio Assessment (ARAS) approach to elucidate the DM problems. Next, a divergence measure based procedure is developed to assess the relative importance of the criteria rationally. To do this, a novel divergence measure is introduced for HFSs. A case study of drug selection for COVID-19 disease is considered to demonstrate the practicability and efficacy of the developed idea in real-life applications. Afterward, the outcome shows that Remdesivir is the best medicine for patients with mild symptoms of the COVID-19. Sensitivity analysis is presented to ensure the permanence of the introduced framework. Moreover, a comprehensive comparison with existing models is discussed to show the advantages of the developed framework. Finally, the results prove that the introduced ARAS approach is more effective and reliable than the existing models. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

There is little research on individuals' COVID-19 vaccination decision-making. Objective: We aimed to determine individual preferences for COVID-19 vaccinations in China, and to assess the factors influencing vaccination decision-making to facilitate vaccination coverage. Methods: A D-efficient discrete choice experiment was conducted across six Chinese provinces selected by the stratified random sampling method. Vaccine choice sets were constructed using seven attributes: vaccine effectiveness, side-effects, accessibility, number of doses, vaccination sites, duration of vaccine protection, and proportion of acquaintances vaccinated. Conditional logit and latent class models were used to identify preferences. Results: Although all seven attributes were proved to significantly influence respondents' vaccination decision, vaccine effectiveness, side-effects and proportion of acquaintances vaccinated were the most important. We also found a higher probability of vaccinating when the vaccine was more effective; risks of serious side effects were small; vaccinations were free and voluntary; the fewer the number of doses; the longer the protection duration; and the higher the proportion of acquaintances vaccinated. Higher local vaccine coverage created altruistic herd incentives to vaccinate rather than free-rider problems. The predicted vaccination uptake of the optimal vaccination scenario in our study was 84.77%. Preference heterogeneity was substantial. Individuals who were older, had a lower education level, lower income, higher trust in the vaccine and higher perceived risk of infection, displayed a higher probability to vaccinate. Conclusions: Preference heterogeneity among individuals should lead health authorities to address the diversity of expectations about COVID-19 vaccinations. To maximize COVID-19 vaccine uptake, health authorities should promote vaccine effectiveness; pro-actively communicate the absence or presence of vaccine side effects; and ensure rapid and wide media communication about local vaccine coverage.

Due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, some restrictions have been applied in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), causing parental concern about visiting healthcare facilities. Objectives To examine the attitudes and factors that influence parents' decisions regarding their children's vaccination during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods In this cross-sectional study, 1,704 caregivers from KSA participated. An implemented Arabic questionnaire directed to the caregivers of children at the age of routine immunizations was filled. It included questions on parent demographics, child data, the decision regarding the vaccines, cause-related questions, and the preferred means to receive the vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results A total of 1,360 participants were included. The majority were from the middle region of KSA. Thirty-nine point five percent (39.5%) of participants chose not to administer the scheduled vaccines to their children, and the main reason was the fear of COVID-19 infection. The main sources of information that encouraged administering the vaccines were the advice of physicians, Saudi Ministry of Health (SMOH) services, 937, and the Sehha application. The majority of the participants chose home immunization visits as the preferred means of vaccination during the COVID-19 pandemic (46.8%). The study showed that approximately 60% of the respondents believed that routine childhood immunizations had no role in spreading the COVID-19 infection, and 59% believed that despite the COVID-19 pandemic, routine childhood vaccines have to be administrated on time.

We survey the determinants that affect the preference for COVID-19 vaccines in Japan, a vaccine hesitant nation. Setting and design: We conducted a randomized conjoint analysis survey of the preference for vaccines on the Internet by recruiting a nonprobability sample of 15,000 Japanese adults. The survey assigned 5 choice tasks to the respondents. In each task, the respondents evaluated 2 hypothetical COVID-19 vaccines and were asked which they would choose. The vaccine attributes included efficacy, major and minor adverse side effects, country of vaccine development and clinical trial, and vaccine type. Treatment: The choice task asked the participants to select a vaccine from 2 hypothetical vaccines as an optional vaccine or select a vaccine as mandated one with a probability of 0.5 for each. Results: Compared to China-developed vaccines, domestically developed or US-developed vaccines raised the choice probability by 37.3 and 27.4 percentage points, respectively. A domestic clinical trial increased the choice probability by 14.8, an increase in efficacy from 50% to 90% increased that by 18.0, and a decrease in the risk of severe adverse side effects from 1 per 10 thousand to 1 per 1 million increased that by 16.9 percentage points, respectively. The vaccine type was irrelevant. Making vaccination compulsory increased the choice probability of China- and Russia-developed vaccines by 0.6 and 0.4, high-risk vaccines by 0.5, and a modestly effective (70%) vaccine by 0.4 percentage points, respectively. General vaccination hesitancy, political positions, demographic characteristics, education, and income were irrelevant. Conclusions: A domestically developed vaccine with a domestic clinical trial could substantially increase the preference for the vaccine.

A rise in the spread of misinformation is thought to have played a significant role in vaccine hesitancy. To maximize uptake, it is important to understand why misinformation has been able to take hold at this time and why it may pose a more significant problem within certain contexts. Objective To understand people's COVID-19 beliefs, their interactions with (mis)information during COVID-19 and attitudes towards a COVID-19 vaccine. Design and Participants Bradford, UK, was chosen as the study site to provide evidence to local decision makers. In-depth phone interviews were carried out with 20 people from different ethnic groups and areas of Bradford during Autumn 2020. Reflexive thematic analysis was conducted. Results Participants discussed a wide range of COVID-19 misinformation they had encountered, resulting in confusion, distress and mistrust. Vaccine hesitancy could be attributed to three prominent factors: safety concerns, negative stories and personal knowledge. The more confused, distressed and mistrusting participants felt about their social worlds during the pandemic, the less positive they were about a vaccine. Conclusions COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy needs to be understood in the context of the relationship between the spread of misinformation and associated emotional reactions.

This study aims to explore the factors that influence the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine among international college students. Methods: The target population constituted international students pursuing various degrees in Jiangsu Province through an online cross-sectional study. A cluster random sampling was performed using a self-administered questionnaire. The Health Belief Model and Knowledge, Attitude/Beliefs, and Practice Theory served as the underlying theories to understanding the factors that influence vaccine acceptance. Results: We received 330 responses. About 36.4% intended to accept the vaccine. The acceptance varied across respondents' place of residence, program of study, continent of origin, knowledge, susceptibility, severity, benefits, and cues to action (p < 0.05). A multivariable logistics regression revealed cues to action (p < 0.001), the perception of COVID-19 vaccination benefits (p = 0.002), and the perception of barriers (p < 0.001) that were associated with vaccine acceptance. Conclusions: The acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine was low among international students. The correct and comprehensive beliefs of the target groups regarding the benefits and barriers of the vaccination must be raised. Various effective social strategies must be adopted to trigger the intention of COVID-19 vaccination.

Vaccine hesitancy is a barrier to full COVID-19 inoculation in the general population. Whether vaccine hesitancy is also a barrier towards optimizing vaccination rates in the MS community is unknown. To investigate vaccine hesitancy and inform efforts to increase vaccine uptake in the MS population, we conducted a follow up survey of a national sample of adults with MS living in the United States who completed an initial survey early in the COVID-19 pandemic. The current study aimed to answer questions vital to understanding vaccine hesitancy, specifically: (1) What is the prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in early 2021? (2) What are the reasons for and factors associated with current hesitancy? (3) How has vaccine willingness and hesitancy changed from April/May 2020 to January/February 2021? and (4) Who has changed in their vaccine willingness? Methods: Adults with MS living in the United States (N = 359) completed two online surveys (the first between 10 April 2020 and 06 May 2020; the second between 11 January 2021 and 08 February 2021) about their willingness and intent to obtain a COVID-19 vaccine. Participants also completed measures to assess factors potentially related to vaccine hesitancy, including demographics, MS variables, influenza vaccine history, vaccine concerns, and contextual factors, including perceived risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection, trust in COVID-19 information source, anxiety, and loneliness. Results: Of the participants who completed the second survey in early 2021, 20.3% were vaccine hesitant, that is, either reporting that they were undecided (13.9%) or not intending to get vaccinated (6.4%). Vaccine hesitancy decreased between the two surveys, with nearly three-fourths (73.8%) of the second sample reporting that they planned to obtain the COVID-19 vaccine. Vaccine hesitancy was associated with having a lower level of education, being non-White, not having a recent flu vaccination, holding a lower perception of one's risk of getting COVID-19, and having lower trust in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Participants who were vaccine hesitant reported concerns about the long-term effects of the vaccine, the vaccine approval process, and the potential impact of the vaccine given their own health conditions/history. Notably, 90% of the undecided group wanted additional information about the vaccine before deciding. Vaccine willingness changed over time, with many of those who were somewhat willing more willing to get the COVID-19 vaccine at survey 2. Individuals who were unwilling at survey 1 were highly likely to remain unwilling at survey 2. Conclusion: Overall, COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy decreased during the pandemic, although one in five adults with MS were hesitant in early 2021. Of those who were undecided, most indicated that they wanted additional information about the vaccine before deciding whether to be vaccinated, suggesting additional educational efforts on the vaccine's safety, long-term effects, and potential health implications are still needed. Findings indicate that public health efforts may be best focused on those who are undecided, whose vaccine hesitancy may change over time and, possibly, with appropriate information or intervention.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2211-0348,2211-0356,,,,SEP,2021,54,,,,,,,,103163,10.1016/j.msard.2021.103163,,,,,,,WOS:000703863900027,34325399,,,,,,yes,359,2(spec. pop-MS)

An Internet-based cross-sectional survey was conducted between December 8 and 28, 2020. Data collection was accomplished using a self-administered questionnaire with questions about socio-demographic characteristics, questions assessing general vaccination-related intentions and behaviors, and the intention to accept COVID-19 vaccination. A sample of 437 responders answered the survey, with 93% being nurses and 7% midwives. A small proportion of the participants would accept a vaccine against COVID-19, while 70% could be qualified as vaccine hesitant. The main reasons for not receiving the COVID-19 vaccine were concerns about the vaccine's expedited development and fear of side effects. More females, individuals with a larger median age, and a higher number of years of working experience, intended to accept the COVID-19 vaccination, compared with those not intended to accept and undecided groups (p < 0.01). Having a seasonal flu vaccination in the last 5 years, receiving the vaccines recommended for health professionals, and working in the private sector were associated with a higher probability of COVID-19 vaccination acceptance.

For COVID-19, these factors are currently unknown for children, with unanswered questions also on children's role in the transmission of the virus, the extent to which the vaccine will decrease transmission, and the expected benefit (if any) to the child. Ultimately, deciding whether to recommend that children receive a novel vaccine for a disease that is not a major threat to them, or to mandate the vaccine, requires precise information on the risks, including disease severity and vaccine safety and effectiveness, a comparative evaluation of the alternatives, and the levels of coercion associated with each. However, the decision also requires balancing self-interest with duty to others, and liberty with usefulness. Separate to ensuring vaccine supply and access, we outline 3 requirements for mandatory vaccination from an ethical perspective: (1) whether the disease is a grave threat to the health of children and to public health, (2) positive comparative expected usefulness of mandatory vaccination, and (3) proportionate coercion.

Methods: This observational cross-sectional study was conducted in the Louisiana State University Medicine Clinic from September 2020 to December 2020. Intent to be vaccinated against the COVID-19 and influenza virus was assessed through a brief questionnaire. Additionally, hesitancy and attitudes regarding vaccines were ascertained using validated 5-point Likert scales. In total, 280 patients completed the questionnaire.

Overall 167 (67%, 95% CI = 61.1-73.0%) of patients were unsure or did not intend to be vaccinated against COVID-19, while only 19.3% (95% CI = 14.4-24.5%) were unsure or did not intend to be vaccinated against the influenza vaccine. Reasons for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy included concern regarding side effects, fear of getting sick from the vaccine, and the absence of vaccine recommendations from their doctor. Concerningly, African American patients demonstrated decreased likelihood of receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. Conclusion: This survey revealed that only 1 in 3 adults intended to be vaccinated against COVID-19, while 8 out of 10 adults intended to receive the influenza vaccine.

Vaccines have been developed in unprecedented time and quantifying levels of hesitancy towards vaccination among the general population is of importance. Methods: Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies using large nationally representative samples (n >= 1000) to examine the percentage of the population intending to vaccinate, unsure, or intending to refuse a COVID-19 vaccine when available. Generic inverse meta-analysis and meta-regression were used to pool estimates and examine time trends. PubMed, Scopus and pre-printer servers were searched from January-November 2020. Registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020223132). Findings: Twenty-eight nationally representative samples (n = 58,656) from 13 countries indicate that as the pandemic has progressed, the percentage of people intending to vaccinate decreased and the percentage of people intending to refuse vaccination increased. Pooled data from surveys conducted during June-October suggest that 60% (95% CI: 49% to 69%) intend to vaccinate and 20% (95% CI: 13% to 29%) intend to refuse vaccination, although intentions vary substantially between samples and countries (I-2 > 90%). Being female, younger, of lower income or education level and belonging to an ethnic minority group were consistently associated with being less likely to intend to vaccinate. Findings were consistent across higher vs. lower quality studies. Interpretation: Intentions to be vaccinated when a COVID-19 vaccine becomes available have been declining across countries and there is an urgent need to address social inequalities in vaccine hesitancy and promote widespread uptake of vaccines as they become available.

Before effective treatments, countering the spread of these infections depends on mitigating, protective behaviours such as social distancing, respecting lockdown, wearing masks, frequent handwashing, travel restrictions, and vaccine acceptance. Previous work has shown that the enacting protective behaviours depends on beliefs about individual vulnerability, threat severity, and one's ability to engage in such protective actions. However, little is known about the genesis of these beliefs in response to an infectious disease epidemic, and the cognitive mechanisms that may link these beliefs to decision making. Active inference (AI) is a recent approach to behavioural modelling that integrates embodied perception, action, belief updating, and decision making. This approach provides a framework to understand the behaviour of agents in situations that require planning under uncertainty. It assumes that the brain infers the hidden states that cause sensations, predicts the perceptual feedback produced by adaptive actions, and chooses actions that minimize expected surprise in the future. In this paper, we present a computational account describing how individuals update their beliefs about the risks and thereby commit to protective behaviours. We show how perceived risks, beliefs about future states, sensory uncertainty, and outcomes under each policy can determine individual protective behaviours. We suggest that these mechanisms are crucial to assess how individuals cope with uncertainty during a pandemic, and we show the interest of these new perspectives for public health policies.",,,,"Friston, Karl/D-9230-2011","Friston, Karl/0000-0001-7984-8909; Bottemanne, Hugo/0000-0003-2958-0849",,,,,,,,,,,,1530-7026,1531-135X,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.3758/s13415-021-00947-0,,OCT 2021,,,,,WOS:000707512700001,34652601,,,,,,no,0,9

Having safe and efficacious vaccines available is only half the equation; people must also take them. We describe a study to identify COVID-19 vaccine attitudes, values and intentions immediately preceding authorization of COVID-19 vaccines in the US. Methods: A national panel survey was conducted to measure intent to receive COVID-19 vaccines as well as disease and vaccine attitudes, values and trust in local, state and federal public health authorities. Results: Greater than 80% of respondents reported confidence they could adhere to COVID recommendations such as mask wearing, social distancing and hand washing. The majority of respondents (70%) reported believing that current drugs were somewhat or very good at treating COVID-19 infection. Vaccine intent fell into three groups: Intenders (50%), Wait and Learn (40%), and Unlikelys (10%). Intent to get vaccinated was substantially lower among African American (32%), and higher among men (56%), those over 60 years of age (61%), those with a Bachelor's degree or higher (63%), and Democrats (63%). The Wait and Learn group, compared to the Intenders, were less likely to report being diagnosed with a high risk condition for COVID-19, receiving an influenza vaccine in the past 12 months, discussing COVID-19 vaccine with their healthcare provider, perceiving COVID-19 as severe, considering a COVID19 vaccine important to stop the spread of infection, and wering a mask usually or almost always. Conclusion: Only half of US adults intend to accept COVID-19 vaccines; most others (40%) are uncertain. Levels of immunity associated with community protection will not be achieved without reaching those who are currently uncertain. Characterizing COVID-19 vaccine attitudes and intentions and ascertaining values and trust in local, state, and federal public health authorities that impact vaccine decision-making are essential.

Vaccine development is proceeding at an unprecedented pace. Once available, it will be important to maximize vaccine uptake and coverage. Objective: To assess intent to be vaccinated against COVID-19 among a representative sample of adults in the United States and identify predictors of and reasons for vaccine hesitancy. Design: Cross-sectional survey, fielded from 16 through 20 April 2020. Setting: Representative sample of adults residing in the United States. Participants: Approximately 1000 adults drawn from the AmeriSpeak probability-based research panel, covering approximately 97% of the U.S. household population. Measurements: Intent to be vaccinated against COVID-19 was measured with the question, When a vaccine for the coronavirus becomes available, will you get vaccinated? Response options were yes, no, and not sure. Participants who responded no or not sure were asked to provide a reason. Results: A total of 991 AmeriSpeak panel members responded. Overall, 57.6% of participants (n = 571) intended to be vaccinated, 31.6% (n = 313) were not sure, and 10.8% (n = 107) did not intend to be vaccinated. Factors independently associated with vaccine hesitancy (a response of no or not sure) included younger age, Black race, lower educational attainment, and not having received the influenza vaccine in the prior year. Reasons for vaccine hesitancy included vaccine-specific concerns, a need for more information, antivaccine attitudes or beliefs, and a lack of trust. Limitations: Participants' intent to be vaccinated was explored before a vaccine was available and when the pandemic was affecting a narrower swath of the United States.

The model adopted is similar to SEIQR, with the infected patients split into groups of asymptomatic subjects and isolated ones. This distinction is particularly important in the current pandemic, due to the fundamental the role of asymptomatic subjects in the virus diffusion. The influence of the control actions is considered in analysing the model, from the calculus of the equilibrium points to the determination of the reproduction number. This choice is motivated by the fact that the available organised data have been collected since from the end of February 2020, and almost simultaneously containment measures, increasing in typology and effectiveness, have been applied. The characteristics of COVID-19, not fully understood yet, suggest an asymmetric diffusion among countries and among categories of subjects. Referring to the Italian situation, the containment measures, as applied by the population, have been identified, showing their relation with the government's decisions; this allows the study of possible scenarios, comparing the impact of different possible choices.",,,,,"DI GIAMBERARDINO, Paolo/0000-0002-9113-8608",,,,,,,,,,,,,2073-8994,,,,MAY,2021,13,5,,,,,,,890,10.3390/sym13050890,,,,,,,WOS:000654583500001,,,,,,,,,

The most promising strategy to control the pandemic was to develop a vaccine. However, vaccination hesitancy is a major threat to world public health. Understanding the reasons behind this hesitancy might help in developing encouragement strategies. This cross-sectional study aimed to assess the knowledge and attitude toward the COVID-19 vaccine in Saudi Arabia. A total of 1599 responses were received; the overall vaccine acceptancy was 79.2%. Age, sex, and nationality of participants significantly predicted the vaccination status. A significantly higher proportion of participants, who reported being vaccinated, or intended to receive the vaccine, stated that the COVID-19 infection is dangerous, or varies from person to person; the vaccine is safe, and think there is a definite need for the vaccine (p < 0.001). The major encouragement factors to receive the vaccine were either confidence in the government decisions (54.8%), or the feeling of responsibility to stop the pandemic (48.7%), whereas the main discouraging factors were concerns about the insufficient clinical trials (11.4%), or the undiscovered side effects (11%).

In this paper, we formulate a model with both epidemiological and economic content to assist this decision-making process. We consider two ways to handle the balance between economic costs and deaths. First, we use the statistical value of life, which in Canada is about C$7 million, to optimize over a single variable, which is the sum of the economic cost and the value of lives lost. Our second method is to calculate the Pareto optimal front when we look at the two variables-deaths and economic costs. In both cases we find that, for most parameter values, the optimal policy is to adopt an initial shutdown level which reduces the reproduction number of the epidemic to close to 1. This level is then reduced once a vaccination programme is underway. Our model also indicates that an oscillating policy of strict and mild shutdowns is less effective than a policy which maintains a moderate shutdown level.",,,,,"Tyson, Rebecca/0000-0002-7373-4473",,,,,,,,,,,,2054-5703,,,,,SEP 8,2021,8,9,,,,,,,202255,10.1098/rsos.202255,,,,,,,WOS:000693572300003,34527265,,,,,,no,,9

The objective of this study was to measure COVID-19 vaccination intentions among a sample of refugees in the United States and the reasons for their vaccine acceptance or hesitancy. Methods From December 2020 through January 2021, we emailed or text messaged anonymous online surveys to 12 bilingual leaders in the Afghan, Bhutanese, Somali, South Sudanese, and Burmese refugee communities in the United States. We asked community leaders to complete the survey and share the link with community members who met the inclusion criteria (arrived in the United States as refugees, were aged >= 18, and currently lived in the United States). We compared the characteristics of respondents who intended to receive the COVID-19 vaccine with those of respondents who did not intend to receive the vaccine or were unsure. We then conducted crude and adjusted logistic regression analysis to measure the association between employment as an essential worker and COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Results Of 435 respondents, 306 (70.3%) indicated that they planned to receive a COVID-19 vaccine.

Evidence Health and vaccine literacy encompass people's knowledge, motivation, and competence to access, understand, appraise and apply health information in order to make judgements and take decisions in everyday life concerning health care, disease prevention and health promotion. Findings Appropriate vaccine communication, which depends greatly on personal and contextual determinants, as well as on societal and environmental circumstances, is essential to reassure people about vaccine efficacy, safety, and possible side effects. However, vaccine confidence is not solely a question of trust in the vaccine's efficacy, safety. and individual protective benefit of vaccination. It also encompasses the mechanism(s) of vaccine activity, immunization schedules, organization and trust in the healthcare system that promotes and delivers the vaccines, and at what costs. When healthcare professionals as science brokers of vaccine knowledge attempt to increase vaccine knowledge and confidence, they must adjust their communication to the educational or health literacy level of their intended audience. Even if their messages are apparently clear and simple, they absolutely need to verify that they are properly understood. Relevance Specific vaccine communication training appears essential to increase vaccine communication skills among healthcare providers.

The scientific investigation of behavioural concepts relating to vaccine hesitancy can be enhanced by the examination of behavioural concepts from the field of consumer sciences. South African consumer scientists study personal decisions that contribute to individuals' well-being, including the decisions to prevent ill health. Current data on the predictors of vaccination decisions do not incorporate consumer science constructs imperative in decision-making, which could provide fresh insights in addressing vaccine hesitancy. This study aimed to investigate and illustrate the analogy between concepts of the Health Belief Model (HBM) as parent model, and consumer behaviour that could affect parents' infant vaccination decisions, by applying a concept derivation approach. The HBM was analysed within the context of public health, including literature from consumers' vaccination decisions, medical decisions, paediatrics, vaccinology, virology and nursing. Through a qualitative, theory derivation strategy, six main concepts of the HBM were redefined to consumer sciences, using four iterative concept derivation steps. Concept derivation resulted in consumer behaviour concepts that could be possible predictors of parents' infant vaccination decisions, including consumers' values; risk perception; consideration of immediate and future consequences; self-efficacy; cues to action; demographics; personal information and knowledge. These predictors could be a starting point for a context-and product-specific consumer primary preventive healthcare decisions model.

As vaccine hesitancy occurs along multiple dimensions, we used a social-ecological framework to guide the examination of COVID-19 vaccine intentions. Methods: Using an online survey in the US conducted in July 2020, we examined intentions to obtain a COVID-19 vaccine, once available. 592 respondents provided data, including measures of demographics, vaccine history, social norms, perceived risk, and trust in sources of COVID-19 information.

Results: Only 59.1% of the sample reported that they intended to obtain a COVID-19 vaccine.

A highly similar pattern was observed among those who were ambivalent about receiving a COVID-19 vaccine compared to those who intended to receive one. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest several avenues for COVID-19 vaccine promotion campaigns, including social network diffusion strategies and cross-partisan messaging, to promote vaccine trust. The racial and gender differences in vaccine intentions also suggest the need to tailor campaigns based on gender and race. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

A Survey to Evaluate Hospital Workers' Opinion,VACCINES,,,,,,,,,,,,"Prospective planning of COVID-19 vaccines allocation will be essential to maximize public health and societal benefits while preserving equity. Decisions about how to allocate limited supplies of vaccines need to be clear about the criteria used in setting priorities, with a specific commitment to transparency and communication. The aim of our study was to think through these competing demands, focusing on the opinion of healthcare workers (HCWs). The primary endpoint of the study was to assess the opinion of all the HCWs in a University based Italian Hospital about the fairest priority order to COVID 19 vaccines and to understand on which criteria the prioritization preferences of HCWs are implicitly based. The secondary endpoints were to assess whether HCWs approach differs from national guidelines and to assess the attitude of HCWs towards mandatory vaccination. An online survey accounting with multiple choice single answer questions and ranking questions was administered to all the HCWs of the University Hospital P. Giaccone of Palermo (Italy) and completed by a total of 465 participants. Almost all respondents confirmed the need for prioritization in COVID-19 vaccination for HCWs (n = 444; 95.5%), essential services and law enforcement (both n = 428; 92%). Clinically vulnerable individuals, HCWs and population over 65 years have been considered the first three groups to be involved in getting vaccination, being indicated as first position group by 26.5%, 32.5% and 21.9% of respondents, respectively. A large majority of respondents (85%) asked for a consistent, transparent and detailed order of priority at a national level. After adjusting for potential confounding due to sex and age, physicians have been found to be statistically significantly associated with the choice of mandatory vaccination (odds ratio (OR): 10.2; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.7-39.1) or with other strategies different from voluntary (OR = 7.2; 95% CI = 1.9-27.3). The broad consensus expressed by respondents towards mandatory vaccination for HCWs is extremely relevant at a time when vaccination hesitation is one of the biggest obstacles to achieving herd immunity. Data show a mismatch in the position attributed to long-term care residents compared to the position of absolute priority assigned by most of national distribution plans, impelling us to reflect on the issue of maximizing benefit from limited healthcare resources. Our findings clearly indicate a preference for COVID-19 frontline health professionals as the first tier of recipients, since they better meet all the criteria (higher risk, immediate system stability). As the guidelines are likely to directly affect a considerable number of citizens, our results call for policy interventions to inform people on the ethical rationale behind vaccine distribution decisions, to avoid resentment and feelings of unfairness.",,,,"; Craxi, Lucia/F-2269-2018","Amodio, Emanuele/0000-0001-5482-5268; Craxi, Lucia/0000-0002-3997-1504; Restivo, Vincenzo/0000-0002-5406-884X; casuccio, alessandra/0000-0002-5676-9535",,,,,,,,,,,,,2076-393X,,,,MAR,2021,9,3,,,,,,,189,10.3390/vaccines9030189,,,,,,,WOS:000634249200001,33668695,,,,,,yes,,9(about allocation survey)

Early reports from states releasing vaccination data by race show that White residents are being vaccinated at significantly higher rates than Black residents. Public health efforts are being targeted to address vaccine hesitancy among Black and other minority populations. However, health care interventions intended to reduce health disparities that do not reflect the underlying values of individuals in underrepresented populations are unlikely to be successful. OBJECTIVE: To identify key factors underlying the disparities in COVID-19 vaccination. METHODS: Primary data were collected from an online survey of a representative sample of the populations of the 4 largest US states (New York, California, Texas, and Florida) between August 10 and September 3, 2020. Using latent class analysis, we built a model identifying key factors underlying the disparities in COVID-19 vaccination. RESULTS: We found that individuals who identify as Black had lower rates of vaccine hesitancy than those who identify as White. This was true overall, by latent class and within latent class. This suggests that, contrary to what is currently being reported, Black individuals are not universally more vaccine hesitant. Combining the respondents who would not consider a vaccine (17%) with those who would consider one but ultimately choose not to vaccinate (11%), our findings indicate that more than 1 in 4 (28%) persons will not be wilting to vaccinate. The no-vaccine rate is highest in White individuals and lowest in Black individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that other factors, potentially institutional, are driving the vaccination rates for these groups. Our model results help point the way to more effective differentiated policies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2376-0540,2376-1032,,,,SEP,2021,27,9,,A,,,S4,S13,,10.18553/jmcp.2021.27.9-a.s4,,,,,,,WOS:000697672000002,34534008,,,,,,yes,??,1

'Nudging', defined as altering the environmental context in which a decision is made or a certain behaviour is enacted, has shown promising results in several health promotion strategies. We present a comprehensive synthesis of evidence regarding the value and impact of nudges to address VH. Methods We conducted a systematic review to determine if nudging can mitigate VH and improve vaccine uptake. Our search strategy used Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and non-MeSH terms to identify articles related to nudging and vaccination in nine research databases. 15 177 titles were extracted and assessed following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The final list of included articles was evaluated using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations framework. Findings Identified interventions are presented according to a framework for behaviour change, MINDSPACE. Articles (n=48) from 10 primarily high-income countries were included in the review. Nudging-based interventions identified include using reminders and recall, changing the way information is framed and delivered to an intended audience, changing the messenger delivering information, invoking social norms and emotional affect (eg, through storytelling, dramatic narratives and graphical presentations), and offering incentives or changing defaults. The most promising evidence exists for nudges that offer incentives to parents and healthcare workers, that make information more salient or that use trusted messengers to deliver information. The effectiveness of nudging interventions and the direction of the effect varies substantially by context. Evidence for some approaches is mixed, highlighting a need for further research, including how successful interventions can be adapted across settings. Conclusion Nudging-based interventions show potential to increase vaccine confidence and uptake, but further evidence is needed for the development of clear recommendations. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic increases the urgency of undertaking nudging-focused research.

We measured the nursing students' risk perceptions, anxiety, fears and beliefs on COVID-19 vaccine; attitudes towards it and vaccine literacy (VL). Design This study is a multi-university study utilizing the quantitative, cross-sectional and predictive approach. Methods Using convenience sampling (n = 1170), we surveyed 10 Saudi universities from November 26, 2020, to December 31, 2020. Forward stepwise multinomial logistic regression was performed in identifying the factors predicting student nurses' intention to vaccinate against COVID-19. Results The overall mean in the risk perception, anxiety and fear was 9.59 (SD = 2.82, possible range = 1-15), 3.95 (SD = 4.77, possible range = 0-20) and 18.17 (SD = 6.65, possible range = 7-35) respectively. They also reported a mean of 29.90 (SD = 6.56, possible range = 8-40) on COVID-19 belief. COVID-19 positive and negative attitudes mean score was 3.64 (SD = 0.92) and 2.72 (SD = 0.90) in a 1-4 range of scores respectively. The functional and interactive-critical COVID-19 VL of the students were at moderate levels. More than half of the respondents (55.9%) intended to be vaccinated against COVID-19, 17.6% did not intend to do so and 26.5% were unsure. High-risk perceptions, low levels of COVID-19 anxiety, positive beliefs and attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccine, and high levels of interactive-critical COVID-19 VL were significant predictors of student nurses' intentions to vaccinate against COVID-19. Conclusion Policymakers could consider the factors identified in this study and why the students did not intend to receive the vaccine in planning a nationwide vaccination program. The colleges of nursing could also utilize the findings in developing educational programs that aim to improve VL and beliefs and attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccine.",,,,"AlQahtani, friyal m/G-6283-2017; Cruz, Jonas Preposi/F-2665-2015; Thobaity, Abdulellah Al/I-1089-2019","AlQahtani, friyal m/0000-0002-0288-9478; Cruz, Jonas Preposi/0000-0002-3758-1414; Thobaity, Abdulellah Al/0000-0002-2313-7355; M.

By far, there has been no specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19. Developing a vaccine against COVID-19 appeared to be the most cost-effective strategy to stop the repeated outbreak. This study aimed to investigate the attitudes of psychiatric patients with regards to COVID-19 vaccination and potential factors that might influence their decision-making process. Methods Psychiatric patients participated in this cross-sectional survey in China. Family caregivers, usually a guardian or next of kin completed the questionnaire when the patient is unable to consent. Data was collected via an online self-administered questionnaire. This questionnaire focused on four main attributes: (1) sociology-demographic characteristics, such as age and sex; (2) questions relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as perceived risk of COVID-19; (3) Flu vaccination history; and (4) attitude towards COVID-19 vaccination and affected factors, such as preferred vaccine type and vaccination site. The associated factors that influenced vaccination acceptance were analyzed by Chi-square analysis and binary logistic regression. Results In total, 416 individuals were recruited, from which 408: 229 patients and 179 family caregivers completed the online survey (response rate: 98.1%). 78.7% of the participants (178 patients and 143 family caregivers) said they intended to receive vaccination once the COVID-19 vaccine became available on the market. Our results showed that participants would have a greater likelihood of joining the COVID-9 immunization programme if the people they knew (community residents or their friends and relatives) presented with high vaccine coverage (OR = 0.24; 95% CI:0.09-0.59). If the pandemic returns, participants were also more likely to accept vaccination (OR = 0.21; 95% CI:0.07-0.62). Moreover, those who believed that the vaccination was an important way to control the COVID-19 pandemic also showed a tendency to receive vaccination (OR = 0.21; 95% CI:0.11-0.40). For those who did not intend to get vaccinated either for themselves or their psychiatric family member, the safety of vaccine was their main concern (71.3%). Conclusions This study showed a high acceptance rate for COVID-19 vaccination amongst psychiatric patients, while worries about the safety of vaccine led to refusal towards vaccination. To increase vaccination uptake amongst this vulnerable group, the public health messaging should include updated vaccination coverage in local communities, and the number of newly COVID-19 infected cases. Specific information about vaccine safety concerning psychiatric patients; as well as the importance of vaccination in controlling the pandemic should be explained in detail.",,,,,"HUANG, WANLI/0000-0002-7013-3939",,,,,,,,,,,,,1471-244X,,,,SEP 29,2021,21,1,,,,,,,475,10.1186/s12888-021-03484-9,,,,,,,WOS:000701660000002,34587935,,,,,,yes,~500,2(spec. pop-psychiatric patients)

This situation may lead to a strong incentive for people to buy a vaccine. Therefore, a relevant study to assess individuals' choices and the value of change in welfare from a COVID-19 vaccine is essential. Objective This study aimed to estimate the willingness-to-pay (WTP) value for a vaccine for COVID-19. We also identify the variables that influence individual vaccination decisions, which could be used in the design of vaccination promotion strategies. Methods We use the contingent valuation method in its double-bounded dichotomous choice format. The estimation coefficients are calculated according to the maximum likelihood method under the assumption of a probit distribution. The sample consisted of 531 individuals, mainly from middle- and high-income socioeconomic groups from Chile between enrolled between 10 July and 10 August 2020. Results The results show a high WTP for the COVID-19 vaccine, with a value up to US$232. Income and education levels and having family members with COVID-19 increased the likelihood of persons paying for a vaccine. There is also a greater fear as the pandemic progresses that people will get sick from COVID-19. Conclusions The high WTP value creates an opportunity for formulating public health policy.

Nevertheless, concerns about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines arose, due to their fast emergency approval. In fact, the problem of antibody-dependent enhancement was raised in the context of COVID-19 vaccines. Methods and findings We introduce a complex extension of the model underlying the pandemic preparedness tool CovidSim 1.1 (http://covidsim.eu/) to optimize vaccination strategies with regard to the onset of campaigns, vaccination coverage, vaccination schedules, vaccination rates, and efficiency of vaccines. Vaccines are not assumed to immunize perfectly. Some individuals fail to immunize, some reach only partial immunity, and-importantly-some develop antibody-dependent enhancement, which increases the likelihood of developing symptomatic and severe episodes (associated with higher case fatality) upon infection. Only a fraction of the population will be vaccinated, reflecting vaccination hesitancy or contraindications. The model is intended to facilitate decision making by exploring ranges of parameters rather than to be fitted by empirical data. We parameterized the model to reflect the situation in Germany and predict increasing incidence (and prevalence) in early 2021 followed by a decline by summer. Assuming contact reductions (curfews, social distancing, etc.) to be lifted in summer, disease incidence will peak again. Fast vaccine deployment contributes to reduce disease incidence in the first quarter of 2021, and delay the epidemic outbreak after the summer season. Higher vaccination coverage results in a delayed and reduced epidemic peak. A coverage of 75%-80% is necessary to prevent an epidemic peak without further drastic contact reductions. Conclusions With the vaccine becoming available, compliance with contact reductions is likely to fade. To prevent further economic damage from COVID-19, high levels of immunization need to be reached before next year's flu season, and vaccination strategies and disease management need to be flexibly adjusted. The predictive model can serve as a refined decision support tool for COVID-19 management.",,,,,"Tsoungui Obama, Henri Christian Junior/0000-0001-7526-0809; Teboh-Ewungkem, Miranda/0000-0002-0765-4969",,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,APR 22,2021,16,4,,,,,,,e0245417,10.1371/journal.pone.0245417,,,,,,,WOS:000644138300094,33886573,,,,,,,,

We developed and evaluated an interactive web tool providing transparent and reliable information on the benefits and risks of COVID-19 vaccination. Methods The most recent scientific data at the time of the study were implemented into an interactive web tool offering individualized information on the risks of COVID-19 infection-related events versus vaccination-related serious adverse events. The tool was evaluated during a before-and-after impact study nested in ComPaRe, a French e-cohort of adult patients with chronic conditions. Primary outcome was the proportion of patients intending to receive vaccination after using the tool, among those not intending to receive it at baseline. Results Between January 8 and 14, 2021, we enrolled 3152 patients in the study [mean age 55.2 (SD: 16.9), 52.9% women and 63% with >= 2 chronic conditions]. Before consulting the tool, 961 (30.5%) refused to be vaccinated until further data on efficacy/safety was obtained and 239 (7.5%) outright refused vaccination. Among these 1200 patients, 96 (8.0%, number needed to treat: 12.5) changed their mind after consulting the tool and would subsequently accept vaccination. Conclusions Our interactive web tool represents a scalable method to help increase the intent to receive COVID-19 vaccination among patients with chronic conditions and address vaccine hesitancy.

Approximately half (53.6%) reported intending to be vaccinated, 16.7% did not intend, and 29.7% were unsure. In the adjusted stepwise multinominal logistic regression, Black and Hispanic respondents were significantly less likely to report intending to be vaccinated as were respondents who were females, younger, and those who were more politically conservative. Compared to those who reported positive vaccine intentions, respondents with negative vaccine intentions were significantly less likely to report that they engaged in the COVID-19 prevention behaviors of wearing masks (aOR = 0.53, CI = 0.37-0.76) and social distancing (aOR = 0.22, CI = 0.12-0.42). In a sub-analysis of reasons not to be vaccinated, significant race/ethnic differences were observed. This national survey indicated a modest level of COVID-19 vaccine intention.

Vaccination is the most effective way of controlling infectious diseases, while success is challenged by individuals and groups who choose to delay or refuse vaccines. The objective of the present study was to assess the intention of healthcare workers in Eastern Ethiopia to receive the second round of COVID-19 vaccine. Methods: Institution-based cross-sectional survey research design was used to collect quantitative data from a representative sample of healthcare workers in Dire Dawa, Haramaya, and Harar towns of Eastern Ethiopia. The correctly filled questionnaires were selected and entered into SPSS software for further analysis, where frequency tables, percentages, mean, and multinomial logistic regression analysis were used in the process. Results: The findings revealed that most (61.6%) of the research participants are willing to receive the second round of COVID-19 vaccine, and 10.3% reported that they have not decided yet. Moreover, the main reason for respondents' lack of intention to receive the second round of COVID-19 vaccine is the belief that the first round of COVID-19 vaccine is sufficient to prevent infection (27.8%) followed by concern over the safety or side effects of the vaccine (26.6%). Above all, the healthcare workers' intention of taking the second round of COVID-19 vaccine is significantly associated to having children (OR=0.362, P<0.05; 95% CI: 3.279-5465.189), previous interaction with someone infected by COVID-19 (OR=1.480, P<0.05; 95% CI: 3.949-0.055), the perception that COVID-19 causes a severe illness (OR=0.018, P<0.05, 95% CI: 13.489-196.391), and experience of receiving the first round of COVID-19 vaccine (OR=50431.104, P<0.01; 95% CI: 408.789-626.00). Conclusion: The present study has shown that healthcare workers in Eastern Ethiopia have a good intention of receiving the second round of COVID-19 vaccine. Nevertheless, the findings have also made it clear that there are still issues to be addressed as far as both willingness to receive the second round of the vaccine and experience of taking the first round of the vaccine are concerned. It is, therefore, important that sufficient training should be given to the healthcare workers in the area in order to raise their level of awareness and enhance their willingness to receive the second round of the vaccine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1178-6973,,,,,,2021,14,,,,,,3071,3082,,10.2147/IDR.S326055,,,,,,,WOS:000684345700002,34408451,,,,,,yes,?,3(spec. pop-health care workers second shot.)

Decisions regarding initiation or continuation of disease-modifying therapy for multiple sclerosis have to consider the potential relevance to the pandemic. Understanding the mechanism of action and the possible idiosyncratic effects of each therapeutic agent on the immune system is imperative during this special time. The infectious side-effect profile as well as the route and frequency of administration of each therapeutic agent should be carefully considered when selecting a new treatment or deciding on risk mitigation strategies for existing therapy. More importantly, the impact of each agent on the future severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type-2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine should be carefully considered in treatment decisions. Moreover, some multiple sclerosis therapies may have beneficial antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2 while others may have beneficial immune-modulating effects against the cytokine storm and hyperinflammatory phase of the disease. Conventional injectables have a favorable immune profile without an increased exposure risk and therefore may be suitable for mild multiple sclerosis during the pandemic. However, moderate and highly active multiple sclerosis will continue to require treatment with oral or intravenous high-potency agents but a number of risk mitigation strategies may have to be implemented. Immune-modulating therapies such as the fumerates, sphinogosine-1P modulators, and natalizumab may be anecdotally preferred over cell-depleting immunosuppressants during the pandemic from the immune profile standpoint. Within the cell-depleting agents, selective (ocrelizumab) or preferential (cladribine) depletion of B cells may be relatively safer than non-selective depletion of lymphocytes and innate immune cells (alemtuzumab). Patients who develop severe iatrogenic or idiosyncratic lymphopenia should be advised to maintain social distancing even in areas where lockdown has been removed or ameliorated. Patients with iatrogenic hypogammaglobulinemia may require prophylactic intravenous immunoglobulin therapy in certain situations. When the future SARS-CoV-2 vaccine becomes available, patients with multiple sclerosis should be advised that certain therapies may interfere with mounting a protective immune response to the vaccine and that serological confirmation of a response may be required after vaccination. They should also be aware that most multiple sclerosis therapies are incompatible with live vaccines if a live SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is developed. In this article, we review and compare disease-modifying therapies in terms of their effect on the immune system, published infection rates, potential impact on SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility, and vaccine-related implications.

Vaccines can prevent infectious diseases, including against seasonal influenza, pneumococcal diseases, herpes zoster and COVID-19. However, the uptake of vaccination among older adults varies across settings and groups. Communication with healthcare workers can play an important role in older people's decisions to vaccinate. To support an informed decision about vaccination, healthcare workers should be able to identify the older person's knowledge gaps, needs and concerns. They should also be able to share and discuss information about the person's disease risk and disease severity; the vaccine's effectiveness and safety; and practical information about how the person can access vaccines. Therefore, healthcare workers need good communication skills and to actively keep up-to-date with the latest evidence. An understanding of their perceptions and experiences of this communication can help us train and support healthcare workers and design good communication strategies. Objectives To explore healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences of communicating with older adults about vaccination. Search methods We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL and Scopus on 21 March 2020. We also searched Epistemonikos for related reviews, searched grey literature sources, and carried out reference checking and citation searching to identify additional studies. We searched for studies in any language. Selection criteria We included qualitative studies and mixed-methods studies with an identifiable qualitative component. We included studies that explored the perceptions and experiences of healthcare workers and other health system staff towards communication with adults over the age of 50 years or their informal caregivers about vaccination. Data collection and analysis We extracted data using a data extraction form designed for this review. We assessed methodological limitations using a list of predefined criteria. We extracted and assessed data regarding study authors' motivations for carrying out their study. We used a thematic synthesis approach to analyse and synthesise the evidence. We used the GRADE-CERQuaI (Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research) approach to assess our confidence in each finding. We examined each review finding to identify factors that may influence intervention implementation and we developed implications for practice. Main results We included 11 studies in our review. Most studies explored healthcare workers' views and experiences about vaccination of older adults more broadly but also mentioned communication issues specifically. All studies were from high-income countries. The studies focused on doctors, nurses, pharmacists and others working in hospitals, clinics, pharmacies and nursing homes. These healthcare workers discussed different types of vaccines, including influenza, pneumococcal and herpes zoster vaccines. The review was carried out before COVID-19 vaccines were available. We downgraded our confidence in several of the findings from high confidence to moderate, low or very low confidence. One reason for this was that some findings were based on only small amounts of data. Another reason was that the findings were based on studies from only a few countries, making us unsure about the relevance of these findings to other settings. Healthcare workers reported that older adults asked about vaccination to different extents, ranging from not asking about vaccines at all, to great demand for information (high confidence finding). When the topic of vaccination was discussed, healthcare workers described a lack of information, and presence of misinformation, fears and concerns about vaccines among older adults (moderate confidence). The ways in which healthcare workers discussed vaccines with older adults appeared to be linked to what they saw asthe aim of vaccination communication. Healthcare workers differed among themselves in their perceptions of this aim and about their own roles and the roles of older adults in vaccine decisions. Some healthcare workers thought it was important to provide information but emphasised the right and responsibility of older adults to decide for themselves. Others used information to persuade and convince older adults to vaccinate in order to increase 'compliance' and 'improve' vaccination rates, and in some cases to gain financial benefits. Other healthcare workers tailored their approach to what they believed the older adult needed or wanted (moderate confidence). Healthcare workers believed that older adults' decisions could be influenced by several factors, including the nature of the healthcare worker-patient relationship, the healthcare worker's status, and the extent to which healthcare workers led by example (low confidence). Our review also identified factors that are likely to influence how communication between healthcare workers and older adults take place. These included issues tied to healthcare workers' views and experiences regarding the diseases in question and the vaccines; as welt as their views and experiences of the organisational and practical implementation of vaccine services. Authors' conclusions There is little research focusing specifically on healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences of communication with older adults about vaccination. The studies we identified suggest that healthcare workers differed among themselves in their perceptions about the aim of this communication and about the role of older adults in vaccine decisions. Based on these findings and the other findings in our review, we have developed a set of questions or prompts that may help health system planners or programme managers when planning or implementing strategies for vaccination communication between healthcare workers and older adults.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1469-493X,1361-6137,,,,,2021,,7,,,,,,,CD013706,10.1002/14651858.CD013706.pub2,,,,,,,WOS:000679985300002,34282603,,,,,,,,

We assessed HCWs' willingness to be vaccinated and reasons underlying hesitancy. Methods: Cross-sectional survey across 17 healthcare institutions. HCWs eligible for vaccination (PfizerBioNTech mRNA) in December 2020 were invited to receive immunization. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify predictors of acceptance. Reasons for refusal among those who never intended to be vaccinated (ie, firm refusers) and those who preferred delaying vaccination (ie, vaccine hesitants) were assessed. Results: Among 2,761 respondents (72% female, average age, 44), 2,233 (80.9%) accepted the vaccine. Physicians, environmental services workers and healthcare managers were more likely to accept vaccination compared to nurses. Male sex, age over 50, rehabilitation center workers, and occupational COVID-19 exposure were independently associated with vaccine acceptance by multivariate analysis. Factors for refusal included vaccine novelty, wanting others to receive it first, and insufficient time for decision-making. Among those who declined, 74% reported they may accept future vaccination. Vaccine firm refusers were more likely than vaccine hesitants to distrust pharmaceutical companies and to prefer developing a natural immunity by getting COVID-19. Conclusions: Vaccine hesitancy exists among HCWs. Our findings provide useful information to plan future interventions and improve acceptance.

Aims To determine the intent to accept COVID-19 vaccination among healthcare workers at a London Hospital Trust and examine variation in uptake between demographic groups. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional survey open to staff working at the trust. Staff rated on a five-point scale the likelihood of them accepting COVID-19 vaccination. Results We received 514 responses, representing 16% of the workforce. About 59% of staff intended to seek vaccination, 24% to reject and 17% were unsure. There was significantly reduced intended uptake in females, younger age groups, healthcare assistants, nurses, staff of black ethnic backgrounds and those who rejected influenza vaccination. Safety was the dominant concern. Conclusions Our study finds COVID-19 vaccinate hesitancy is prevalent among healthcare workers at a London Hospital Trust.

This study aimed to measure potential spatial access to COVID-19 vaccination centres in Mashhad, the second-most populous city in Iran. Methods: The 2021 age structure of the urban census tracts was integrated into the enhanced two-step floating catchment area model to improve accuracy. The model was developed based on three different access scenarios: only public hospitals, only public healthcare centres and both (either hospitals or healthcare centres) as potential vaccination facilities. The weighted decision-matrix and analytic hierarchy process, based on four criteria (i.e. service area, accessibility index, capacity of vaccination centres and distance to main roads), were used to choose potential vaccination centres looking for the highest suitability for residents. Global Moran's index (GMI) was used to measure the spatial autocorrelation of the accessibility index in different scenarios and the proposed model. Results: There were 26 public hospitals and 271 public healthcare centres in the study area. Although the exclusive use of public healthcare centres for vaccination can provide the highest accessibility in the eastern and north-eastern parts of the study area, our findings indicate that including both public hospitals and public healthcare centres provide high accessibility to vaccination in central urban part. Therefore, a combination of public hospitals and public healthcare centres is recommended for efficient vaccination coverage. The value of GMI for the proposed model (accessibility to selected vaccination centres) was calculated as 0.53 (Z = 162.42, P < 0.01). Both GMI and Z-score values decreased in the proposed model, suggesting an enhancement in accessibility to COVID-19 vaccination services. Conclusions: The periphery and poor areas of the city had the least access to COVID-19 vaccination centres. Measuring spatial access to COVID-19 vaccination centres can provide valuable insights for urban public health decision-makers.

J,"Minkoff, H; Ecker, J",,,,"Minkoff, Howard; Ecker, Jeffrey",,,Balancing risks: making decisions for maternal treatment without data on fetal safety,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Challenges arise when treatment to improve maternal health brings the possibility of risk to fetal health. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine is the most recent, but hardly the only, example. Because pregnant patients are often specifically excluded from trials of new therapies, this is often the dilemma that patients and providers face when considering new treatments. In this study, we used the COVID-19 vaccine as an exemplar to question the broader issue of how society, in general, and obstetricians, in particular, should balance obligations to pregnant women?s right of access to new therapeutic agents with the physician?s desire to protect the fetus from potential risks. We will argue that in almost all circumstances (with few exceptions, as will also be discussed), maternal benefit and respect for autonomy create the uncertainty that absent safety data bring. Consequently, if pregnant women choose to try new interventions and treatments, such as the COVID-19 vaccination, they should be offered those new regimens and their decision supported. In addition, we will argue that the right solution to avoid the dilemma of absent data is to include pregnant individuals in clinical trials studying new treatments, drugs, and other therapies. We will also discuss the basis for our opinion, which are mainstream obstetrical ethics, precedents in law (supreme court ruling that forbids companies to exclude women from jobs that might pose a risk to the fetus), and historic events (thalidomide). The ethical framework includes the supposition that sacrifice to improve fetal outcome is a virtue and not a mandate. Denying a pregnant patient treatment because of threats to their life can create absurd and paradoxical conse-quences. Either requiring abortion or premature delivery before proceeding with treat-ments to optimize maternal health, or risking a patient?s own life and ability to parent a child by delaying treatment brings clear and significant risks to fetal and/or neonatal outcomes. With rare exceptions, properly and ethically balancing such consequential actions cannot be undertaken without considering the values and goals of the pregnant patient. Therefore, active participation of both the pregnant patient and their physician in shared decision making is needed.",,,,,"Minkoff, Howard/0000-0002-7800-7195",,,,,,,,,,,,0002-9378,1097-6868,,,,MAY,2021,224,5,,,,,479,483,,10.1016/j.ajog.2021.01.025,,,,,,,WOS:000646905600005,33539824,,,,,,,,

Objectives: This study aimed to ascertain the willingness of mothers of children attending two institutions in Southeast Nigeria to accept the COVID-19 vaccine and factors that may be associated with their choices. Methodology: This was a cross-sectional study carried out among 577 mothers who presented with their children in two tertiary health institutions in southeast Nigeria. Results: Majority of the respondents (93.9%) were aware of the COVID-19 vaccine. Majority of the respondents, 89.4%, noted that children were not in high priority groups for COVID-19 vaccination in Nigeria. Only 6.9% of the respondents intend to receive the COVID-19 vaccination. Also, a minor proportion of the respondents (4.9%) were willing to vaccinate their children with the COVID-19 vaccine. The odds of receiving the Covid-19 vaccine were four times greater in those who believed that they could be infected than in those who believed that they could not be infected (AOR = 4.0. 95% CI:1.8-8.7).

Methods: The study population comprises 1880 people residing in different countries that answer a prepared questionnaire. The questionnaire topics are demographics, historical issues, participants' attitudes and beliefs regarding vaccines, concerns, and vaccine hesitancy. Results: Attitudes and beliefs relating to vaccines in general, and the COVID-19 vaccine, were ascertained. Overall, 66.81% of the contributors would like to be vaccinated against COVID-19, while %33.19 did not intend to be vaccinated. Reasons for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy included concern regarding vaccine side effects, fear of getting sick from the uptake of the vaccine, and the absence of accurate vaccine promotion news. Individuals with higher education believe that India (68.6%) produces the best vaccine (P < 0.001), while healthcare workers think the Chinese vaccine (44.2%) is the best (P = 0.020).

Methods All rheumatology patients attending a large suburban health network were invited to participate in an anonymized online survey. The primary outcome of interest was SARS-COV-2 vaccine acceptance. Results The mean (SD) age of respondents (n = 641) was 52.7 (15.1) years and 74.4% (n = 474) were female. Sixty-five percent were willing to have a SARS-COV-2 vaccine, while 34.4% were vaccine-hesitant (unwilling or undecided). On multivariate analysis, vaccine acceptance was associated with smoking (OR: 2.25 [95% CI: 1.22-4.15; p = .009]), history of malignancy (OR: 2.51 [95% CI: 1.19-5.26; p = .015]), influenza or pneumococcal vaccination in the preceding year (OR: 2.69 [95% CI: 1.78-4.05; p < .001]) and number of COVID-Safe measures practiced (OR: 1.54 [95% CI: 1.05-2.26; p = .027]). Vaccine acceptance correlated with positive beliefs regarding vaccine efficacy (r = 0.40; p < .001) and safety (r = 0.36; p < .001). Vaccine acceptance correlated negatively with concerns regarding side-effects (r = -0.30; p < .001) and vaccine-associated RMD flare (r = -0.21; p < .001). In vaccine-hesitant respondents, 39.2% were more likely to accept vaccination if given a choice of which vaccine they receive and 54.5% if their rheumatologist recommended it. Twenty-seven percent of patients on immunomodulators were willing to withhold medications while 42.1% were willing if advised by their rheumatologist. Conclusion SARS-COV-2 vaccine hesitancy is prevalent amongst RMD patients and associated with concerns regarding vaccine safety, efficacy, side effects and RMD flare.

However, adherence to social distance measures presumably requires knowledge and understanding of the current social distancing restrictions. Methods A modified version of the Theory of Planned Behaviour examined the role of knowledge and understanding of current social distancing measures in predicting intentions to adhere to social distancing restrictions. An online survey was administered to respondents (N = 374) in Melbourne, Australia during a period of heightened social distancing restrictions. In addition to measuring respondents' general intentions to adhere to restrictions, vignettes were used to assess intended behaviour in specific situations. Results Knowledge of social distancing restrictions predicted intentions to adhere in specific situations, but not general intentions to adhere. Knowledge of restrictions also predicted positive attitudes towards current restrictions and a greater perceived ability to adhere to the restrictions, while positive attitudes was a good predictor of both general and specific intentions to adhere. Conclusions The findings suggest that attitudes towards restrictions may influence whether individuals attempt to adhere to restrictions, but knowledge of the restrictions influences whether the intended behaviour actually adheres to current restrictions.

Methods An anonymous online questionnaire was conducted between 23rd December 2020 and 5th January 2021 in various provinces in Syria. A total of 3402 adults were sampled to reflect the population demographic factors. Attitudinal factors included Covid-19 fears, risks, and beliefs on the origin.

Methods We conducted a cross-sectional survey with a self-administered questionnaire delivered to 329 cancer patients in 3 oncology cancer centers in Tunisia between February-May 2021. Logistic regression was used to evaluate odds ratio predicting patient's intentions toward the vaccine. Results Acceptance rate was 50.5%, 28.3% (n = 93) reported to definitely refuse the vaccine and 21.2% (n = 70) did not make their decision yet. High educational level, history of comorbidities, history of influenza vaccination in the current season, and patient's opinion about the severity of COVID-19 did not predict vaccine resistance. However, patients who think that the vaccine may interfere with treatment efficacy (OR = 7.28, 95%CI [2.5-12.32]), or may impact cancer outcome (OR = 6.14, 95%CI [2.27-16.7]), were significantly more likely to refuse the vaccine.

Safety concerns were also significant predictive factors (OR = 7.9, 95%CI [4.10-11.27].

In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have entered an era of unprecedented infodemic. There has never been a more urgent time to address the long-standing question of how to overcome the deleterious influence of exposure to online mis/disinformation on vaccine uptake. eHealth literacy, a skill set including media literacy, is key to navigating the web in search for health information and processing the one encountered through social media. Studies assessing the impact of increasing eHealth literacy on behavioral attitudes and health outcomes in the general population are relatively scarce to date. Yet for many reasons, leveraging eHealth literacy skills, and more specifically, media literacy, could be of great value to help mitigate the detrimental effects of erroneous information on vaccination decision-making. In this paper, we make the case that eHealth and media literacies should be viewed as fundamental skills that have the potential to empower citizens to better recognize online mis/disinformation and make informed decisions about vaccination as any other health matters.",,,,,"MAYAUD, Philippe/0000-0001-5730-947X",,,,,,,,,,,,2164-5515,2164-554X,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1080/21645515.2021.1874218,,FEB 2021,,,,,WOS:000621292700001,33625960,,,,,,no,,9

We analyzed a broad array of individual's psychological dispositions with regard to decision-making about COVID-19 vaccination in Japan. Methods: A nationally representative cross-sectional web survey was conducted with 30053 Japanese adults aged 20 years or older at the end of February 2021. In addition to the question on the individual's intention to be vaccinated against COVID-19, respondents were asked about their sociodemographic, health-related, and psychological characteristics as well as information sources about COVID-19 and their levels of trust. Also, those who responded 'not sure' or 'no' regarding intention to take COVID-19 vaccine were asked why. Multinomial logistic regression with sparse group Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) penalty was used to compute adjusted odds ratios for factors associated with the intention (not sure/no versus yes). Findings: The percentages of respondents who answered 'not sure' or 'no' regarding intention to be vaccinated against COVID-19 vaccine were 32.9% and 11.0%, respectively. After adjusting for covariates, the perceived risks of COVID-19, perceived risk of a COVID-19 vaccine, perceived benefits of a COVID-19 vaccine, trust in scientists and public authorities, and the belief that healthcare workers should be vaccinated were significantly associated with vaccination intention. Several sources of information about COVID-19 were also significantly associated with vaccination intention, including physicians, nurses, and television, medical information sites with lower odds of being unsure or unwilling, and internet news sites, YouTube, family members, and scientists and researchers with higher odds. The higher the level of trust in television as a source of COVID-19 information, the higher the odds of responding 'not sure' (odds ratio 1.11, 95% confidence interval 1.01-1.21). We also demonstrated that many respondents presented concerns about the side effects and safety of a COVID-19 vaccine as a major reason for being unsure or unwilling. To decide whether or not to get the vaccine, many respondents requested more information about the compatibilities between the vaccine and their personal health conditions, whether other people had been vaccinated, the effectiveness of vaccines against variants, and doctors' recommendations. Interpretation: Our findings suggest that public health messaging based on the sociodemographic and psychological characteristics of those who are unsure or unwilling regarding intention to be vaccinated against COVID-19 vaccine may help to increase vaccine uptake amongst this population.

In this paper, we describe a COVID-19 model, called Covasim (COVID-19 Agent-based Simulator), that we developed to help answer these questions. Covasim can be tailored to the local context by using detailed data on the population (such as the population age distribution and number of contacts between people) and the epidemic (such as diagnosed cases and reported deaths). While Covasim can be used to explore theoretical research questions or to make projections, its main purpose is to evaluate the effect of different interventions on the epidemic. These interventions include physical interventions (mobility restrictions and masks), diagnostic interventions (testing, contact tracing, and quarantine), and pharmaceutical interventions (vaccination). Covasim is open-source, written in Python, and comes with extensive documentation, tutorials, and a webapp to ensure it can be used as easily and broadly as possible. In partnership with local stakeholders, Covasim has been used to answer policy and research questions in more than a dozen countries, including India, the United States, Vietnam, and Australia. The COVID-19 pandemic has created an urgent need for models that can project epidemic trends, explore intervention scenarios, and estimate resource needs. Here we describe the methodology of Covasim (COVID-19 Agent-based Simulator), an open-source model developed to help address these questions. Covasim includes country-specific demographic information on age structure and population size; realistic transmission networks in different social layers, including households, schools, workplaces, long-term care facilities, and communities; age-specific disease outcomes; and intrahost viral dynamics, including viral-load-based transmissibility. Covasim also supports an extensive set of interventions, including non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as physical distancing and protective equipment; pharmaceutical interventions, including vaccination; and testing interventions, such as symptomatic and asymptomatic testing, isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine. These interventions can incorporate the effects of delays, loss-to-follow-up, micro-targeting, and other factors. Implemented in pure Python, Covasim has been designed with equal emphasis on performance, ease of use, and flexibility: realistic and highly customized scenarios can be run on a standard laptop in under a minute. In collaboration with local health agencies and policymakers, Covasim has already been applied to examine epidemic dynamics and inform policy decisions in more than a dozen countries in Africa, Asia-Pacific, Europe, and North America.",,,,,"Mistry, Dina/0000-0002-1598-1388; Hagedorn, Brittany/0000-0002-1489-7168; Panovska-Griffiths, Jasmina/0000-0002-7720-1121",,,,,,,,,,,,1553-734X,1553-7358,,,,JUL,2021,17,7,,,,,,,e1009149,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009149,,,,,,,WOS:000685214500007,,,,,,,,,

Vaccine acceptance decisions can be influenced by multiple factors and people may weigh these factors differently in decision making. The current study aimed to explore COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among college students in South Carolina and examine how they weigh these factors according to their COVID-19 vaccine acceptance levels (i.e. acceptance, hesitance, refusal). Online survey data were collected from 1062 college students in South Carolina between September and October 2020. Multinomial logistic regresssion was used to compare perceived importance of 12 factors affecting levels of vaccine acceptance, controlling for demographic variables. About 26.1% of participants reported they would definitely take COVID-19 vaccines when available. Compared to acceptance group, refusal and hesitance groups considered side effects and vaccine characteristics (e.g. where the vaccine is produced) as important. Hesitance group considered authoritative advice from school/college as important. Acceptance group considered authoritative advice from government/doctors and local availability of the vaccines and local availability of the vaccines as important. Our findings suggest relatively low vaccine acceptance among college students in South Carolina and different factors were considered in their vaccination decision according to their acceptance levels. Tailored vaccine promotion messages should address specific concerns among the refusal and hesitancy groups. Schools should attend to valid communication strategies in vaccine campaign since the hesitancy group considered school's advice as important. College health educators also need to pay attention to the refusal group who do not value duration of protection or authoritative advice as much as their counterparts in vaccine decision making.",,,,,"Tam, Cheuk Chi/0000-0003-2612-0564; Li, Xiaoming/0000-0002-5555-9034; Qiao, Shan/0000-0003-1834-1834",,,,,,,,,,,,1354-8506,1465-3966,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1080/13548506.2021.1983185,,SEP 2021,,,,,WOS:000700376200001,34555955,,,,,,yes,500+,2(spe.

In multivariable models, social norms were a significant and independent predictor of all vaccine delay and intention models. Vaccine delay was associated with low levels of worry about becoming infected with COVID-19, political conservatism, concerns about vaccine side effects, and low levels of believing a vaccine would be effective. Negative vaccine intentions were associated with worries about becoming infected with COVID-19, concerns about vaccine side effects, beliefs that the vaccines were developed too quickly, and low endorsement of the altruistic belief that older people should have vaccination priority.

Protecting healthcare workers including nurses against COVID-19 is crucial, and vaccination could be a viable future option. However, vaccine hesitancy remains a global challenge. Nurses, as a trustworthy and creditable source of vaccine-related information, may build public confidence in vaccination. Hence, research on vaccine hesitancy among nurses is warranted. Objectives: This study estimated nurses' influenza vaccination behaviors and intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine when available, and examined their corresponding 5C psychological antecedents (confidence, complacency, constraints, calculation, and collective responsibility). To investigate the impact of COVID-19-related work demands, the mediation effects of work stress on the association between work demands and COVID-19 vaccination intention were also examined. Design: Cross-sectional online survey Settings: Nurses were invited to participate via the promotion of a professional nursing organization and by personal referrals during the COVID-19 outbreak in Hong Kong between mid-March and late April 2020. Participants: 1,205 eligible nurses (mean age = 40.79, SD = 10.47; 90% being female) were included in the analyses. Methods: Demographics, influenza vaccination, intention to have COVID-19 vaccine, the 5C vaccine hesitancy components, work stress and COVID-19-related work demands (insufficient supply of personal protective equipment, involvement in isolation rooms, and unfavorable attitudes towards workplace infection control policies) were reported in the survey. Results: The influenza vaccine uptake rate and the proportion intending to take COVID-19 vaccine were 49% and 63%, respectively. Influenza vaccination was associated with working in public hospitals and all 5C constructs (more confidence, more collective responsibility and less complacency, constraints, and calculation), whereas stronger COVID-19 vaccination intention was associated with younger age, more confidence, less complacency and more collective responsibility. COVID-19-related demands were associated with greater work stress, and hence stronger COVID-19 vaccination intention. Conclusion: The potential uptake rate of COVID-19 vaccine among nurses was suboptimal to achieve herd immunity. The 5C constructs were useful in predicting influenza vaccination and, to a lesser extent, the intention to take COVID-19 vaccine. The uncertain attributes such as effectiveness, side effects, and effective duration of the COVID-19 vaccine may contribute to this discrepancy. With less work stress among nurses in the post-pandemic period, the intention to take COVID-19 vaccine will likely drop. The 5C constructs should be infused in vaccination campaigns. While a COVID-19 vaccine could be ready soon, the nursing profession may not be ready to accept it. More research work is needed to boost the uptake rate. Tweetable abstract: Less than two-third of nurses intended to take COVID-19 vaccine when available. While a COVID-19 vaccine could be ready soon, nursing profession is not ready to accept it.

As a profoundly religious Buddhist kingdom in South Asia, the country successfully utilized a very unique strategy in promoting COVID-19 vaccine acceptance nationwide. Bhutan incorporated religion, culture, and tradition in their campaign wherein the royal government collaborated with the Zhung Dratsang, the country's central monastic body, in deciding the most auspicious day for the launch of their vaccination rollout by avoiding the one-month long Dana, selecting the first person to be vaccinated in accordance to the Buddhist astrology, and leading the country in chanting the Sangay Menlha, a mantra believed by many as a powerful prayer in warding off diseases. The launch turned out as a feast for all Bhutanese since it seemingly marked the beginning of the last phase of their COVID-19 struggle.

According to this scenario, we conducted a cross-sectional study on a convenience sample of Italian university students aimed at: (1) exploring their attitudes towards a future vaccine to prevent COVID-19 and; (2) evaluating the impact of the university curricula (healthcare vs. non-healthcare curricula) on the intention to vaccinate. Descriptive analysis on the 735 students that answered to the question on the intention to vaccinate showed that 633 (86.1%) students reported that they would choose to have a vaccination for the COVID-19 coronavirus; on the other side, 102 (13.9%) students reported that they would not or be not sure to vaccine (low intention to vaccinate). This means that in our sample more than one student out of 10 shows low intention to vaccinate (vaccine hesitancy). Furthermore, when running analysis comparing healthcare students versus non-healthcare students we found no significant differences in responses' percentage distribution (p = .097).

Collaborative efforts to end COVID-19 have included extensive research on vaccines. Many vaccination campaigns have been launched in many countries, including Vietnam, to create community immunization. However, citizens' willingness to participate is a prerequisite for effective vaccination programs and other related policies. Among all demographic groups, participation rates among young adults are of interest because they are an important workforce and are a source of high infection risk in the community. In March 2021, a pool of approximately 6000 participants in Ho Chi Minh City were randomly polled using an email-based online survey. The exploratory results of 398 valid observations show that students' perceptions of the dangers of COVID-19 and the importance of vaccination were both relatively high (4.62/5 and 4.74/5, respectively). Furthermore, 83.41 percent of students polled (n = 332) chose vaccination, while 16.59 percent chose hesitation (n = 64) and not to be vaccinated (n = 2). More importantly, our estimated results of the Bayesian regression model (BRM) show that the perceived importance of the vaccine, concerns about the vaccine's side effects, and a lack of access to information are the top three reasons for their reluctance and/or refusal to get vaccinated.

The purpose of this study was to examine changes in vaccine intentions and attitudes by sociodemographic characteristics and geographic areas, factors associated with vaccination intent, and reasons for non-vaccination among a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults. Methods: Data from six waves of the Household Pulse Survey (6 January - 29 March 2021) were analyzed. Differences between January and March were assessed using t-tests. Factors associated with vaccination intent were examined in multivariable logistic regression models. Results: From early January to late March, vaccination receipt of >= 1 dose of the COVID-19 vaccine or intention to definitely get vaccinated increased from 54.7 to 72.3%; however, disparities in vaccination intent continued to exist by age group, race/ethnic groups, and socioeconomic characteristics. Vaccine receipt and the intent were the lowest for region 4 (southeastern U.S.) throughout this period. Adults who had a previous COVID-19 diagnosis or were unsure if they have had COVID-19 were less likely to intend to get vaccinated [prevalence ratio = 0.92 (95%CI: 0.90-0.93) and 0.80 (95%CI: 0.74-0.85), respectively]. The belief that a vaccine is not needed increased by more than five percentage points from early January to late March. Conclusion: Intent to definitely get a COVID-19 vaccine increased by almost 18 percentage points from early January to late March; however, younger adults, adults who are non-Hispanic Black or other races, adults of lower socioeconomic status, and adults living in the southeastern U.S. region (Region 4) continue to have higher coverage gaps and levels of vaccine hesitancy.

COVID-19 vaccination was crucial to preventing and eliminating the disease, so vaccine development for COVID-19 was fast-tracked worldwide. Despite the fact that vaccination is commonly recognized as the most effective approach, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), vaccine hesitancy is a global health issue. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey of nurses in four different regions in Italy between 20 and 28 December 2020 to obtain data on the acceptance of the upcoming COVID-19 vaccination in order to plan specific interventions to increase the rate of vaccine coverage. Results: A total of 531 out of the 5000 nurses invited completed the online questionnaire. Most of the nurses enrolled in the study (73.4%) were female. Among the nurses, 91.5% intended to accept vaccination, whereas 2.3% were opposed and 6.2% were undecided. Female sex and confidence in vaccine efficacy represent the main predictors of vaccine intention among the study population using a logistic regression model, while other factors including vaccine safety concerns (side effects) were non-significant. Conclusions: Despite the availability of a safe and effective vaccine, intention to be vaccinated was suboptimal among nurses in our sample. We also found a significant number of people undecided as to whether to accept the vaccine. Contrary to expectations, concerns about the safety of the vaccine were not found to affect the acceptance rate; nurses' perception of vaccine efficacy and female sex were the main influencing factors on attitudes toward vaccination in our sample. Since the success of the COVID-19 immunization plan depends on the uptake rate, these findings are of great interest for public health policies.

This study aimed to assess the perception of community members and willingness to pay for the prospective COVID-19 vaccine in Ibadan, Nigeria. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study design was used. Data were collected using an interviewer-administered questionnaire in September 2020. We studied community members aged 15 years and above using a multi-stage sampling technique. The perceptions of respondents about the COVID-19 vaccine were assessed on eight questions using the five-point Likert scale with a score point of 1 assigned for Strongly Agree, 2 for Agree, 3 for Not decided, 4 for Disagree, and 5 for Strongly disagree. During analysis, we reverse-coded the options by assigning a point of 1 for Strongly disagree, 2 for Disagree, 3 for Not decided, 4 for Agree, and 5 for Strongly disagree. However, questions asked in the negative directions were not reverse-coded during analysis. Eight questions were used to assess the perception of community members regarding the prospective COVID-19 vaccine, and overall, the maximum point was 40. Points greater than or equal to 32 points (80%) implied positive perception. Descriptive statistics were done. CM-square tests were used for the assessment of associations between sociodemographic characteristics and willingness to pay for the prospective COVID-19 vaccine. We conducted logistic regression tests on statistically significant variables at p-values <0.05. Results: The mean age of the 440 respondents studied was 37.22 +/- 15.36 years, 193 (49.00%) were males, and 292 (67.30%) of the respondents had heard of the prospective COVID-19 vaccine.

Method: An online survey was delivered to a U.S. sample (N = 934), assessing the influences of risk perception and fear associated with COVID-19, beliefs about and attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines, self-efficacy, social and psychological contexts, and demographic characteristics on people's intention to get COVID-19 vaccines. Results: Most respondents intended to get vaccinated. However, they tended to underestimate their risks of contracting COVID-19. Disease exposure led to higher uptake intent via the mediation of fear. Safety concerns negatively influenced vaccination intention, while perceived community benefits were positively associated with vaccination intention. Positive attitudes toward vaccines and recent vaccine history were positively linked to vaccination intent. Conclusion: This study attests the effectiveness of HBT constructs in predicting people's intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Practice Implications: The results point to the importance of fostering confidence in vaccine safety and countering overoptimism of individual susceptibility to the disease in interventions promoting COVID-19 vaccines uptake.

This study aimed to explore the prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among the public in Kuwait, to understand their attitudes towards vaccines in general, and to identify predictors of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 4147 adults aged >= 18 years. The snowball sampling strategy was used for data collection through social media and e-mails. A total of 3061 (73.8%) respondents indicated that they were vaccinated or intending to be vaccinated against the COVID-19 infection, while 1086 (26.2%) expressed their vaccine hesitancy. The most common reasons for vaccine hesitancy were the concerns about the vaccine's possible side effects, its rushed development, and its efficacy in preventing the infection. Over half (57.2%) of respondents expressed intermediate to high levels of negative attitude towards vaccines in general. On the multivariable logistic regression analysis, the findings revealed that vaccine hesitancy was significantly more prevalent among respondents aged 30-64 years; females; married or divorced; residents of Hawalli, Al-Farwaniyah, Al-Jahra, and Mubarak Al-Kabeer; had intermediate monthly average income; non-smokers; not feeling worried about catching the infection; do not know whether any of their family members have been infected or died because of COVID-19 infection; do not have a large extent of confidence in the Kuwait health system's ability to handle the pandemic; did not receive influenza vaccine during the last year; refused or elected to forego a doctor-recommended vaccine; did not receive adequate information from the public health authorities/healthcare providers about the COVID-19 vaccines; none of their first-degree family members received or were intending to receive the vaccine; and expressed intermediate to high levels of negative attitudes towards vaccines in general.

In this study, we examine how maternal posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and trauma history relate to mothers' beliefs and intentions about the COVID-19 vaccine for themselves and their children. Methods A total of 240 mothers with a mental health history participating in a parenting study answered online survey questions via Prolific. Questions assessed: (a) trauma indictors (past diagnosis, current symptoms, and lifetime exposure to events); (b) vaccine measures (intentions for self and child, COVID-19 vaccine confidence, general vaccine perceived safety, reasoning about vaccine intentions, sources of influence on intentions); and (c) possible explanatory variables (institutional distrust, negative worldviews). ANCOVAs and regression analyses were used. Results When compared with mothers with other mental health diagnoses, mothers with a PTSD history had significantly less confidence in the COVID-19 vaccine and less intent to get the vaccine for themselves or their child. These effects were explained by greater institutional distrust (i.e., significant indirect effects). Mothers with a previous PTSD diagnosis also expressed different reasons for vaccine hesitancy (e.g., less belief in science) and ascribed less influence to healthcare and governmental sources in vaccine decision-making.

Intention for vaccine acceptance varies over time. COVID-19 vaccination decisions are influenced by many factors including knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs; social networks; communication environment; COVID-19 community rate; cultural and religious influences; ease of access; and the organization of health and community services and policies. Reflecting vaccine acceptance complexity, the Royal Society of Canada Working Group on COVID-19 Vaccine Acceptance developed a framework with four major factor domains that influence vaccine acceptance (people, communities, health care workers; immunization knowledge; health care and public health systems including federal/provincial/territorial/indigenous factors)-each influencing the others and all influenced by education, infection control, extent of collaborations, and communications about COVID-19 immunization. The Working Group then developed 37 interrelated recommendations to support COVID vaccine acceptance nested under four categories of responsibility: 1. People and Communities, 2.

Thus, mobility restrictions of varying degrees up to and including nationwide lockdowns have been implemented in over 200 countries. To appropriately target the timing, location, and severity of measures intended to encourage social distancing at a country level, it is essential to predict when and where outbreaks will occur, and how widespread they will be. Methods We analyze aggregated, anonymized health data and cell phone mobility data from Israel. We develop predictive models for daily new cases and the test positivity rate over the next 7 days for different geographic regions in Israel. We evaluate model goodness of fit using root mean squared error (RMSE). We use these predictions in a five-tier categorization scheme to predict the severity of COVID-19 in each region over the next week. We measure magnitude accuracy (MA), the extent to which the correct severity tier is predicted. Results Models using mobility data outperformed models that did not use mobility data, reducing RMSE by 17.3% when predicting new cases and by 10.2% when predicting the test positivity rate. The best set of predictors for new cases consisted of 1-day lag of past 7-day average new cases, along with a measure of internal movement within a region. The best set of predictors for the test positivity rate consisted of 3-days lag of past 7-day average test positivity rate, along with the same measure of internal movement. Using these predictors, RMSE was 4.812 cases per 100,000 people when predicting new cases and 0.79% when predicting the test positivity rate. MA in predicting new cases was 0.775, and accuracy of prediction to within one tier was 1.0. MA in predicting the test positivity rate was 0.820, and accuracy to within one tier was 0.998. Conclusions Using anonymized, macro-level data human mobility data along with health data aids predictions of when and where COVID-19 outbreaks are likely to occur. Our method provides a useful tool for government decision makers, particularly in the post-vaccination era, when focused interventions are needed to contain COVID-19 outbreaks while mitigating the collateral damage from more global restrictions.",,,,,"Guan, Grace/0000-0002-4904-6072",,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,JUL 20,2021,16,7,,,,,,,e0253865,10.1371/journal.pone.0253865,,,,,,,WOS:000678123200019,34283839,,,,,,,,

The behavioral factors of vaccine hesitancy or refusal are a crucial dimension that need to be understood in order to design appropriate interventions. The aim of this study was to explore the behavioral determinants of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and to provide recommendations to increase the acceptance and uptake of COVID-19 vaccines in Bangladesh. Methods We employed a Barrier Analysis (BA) approach to examine twelve potential behavioral determinants (drawn from the Health Belief Model [HBM] and Theory of Reasoned Action [TRA]) of intended vaccine acceptance. We conducted 45 interviews with those who intended to take the vaccine (Acceptors) and another 45 interviews with those who did not have that intention (Non-acceptors). We performed data analysis to find statistically significant differences and to identify which beliefs were most highly associated with acceptance and non-acceptance with COVID-19 vaccines. Results The behavioral determinants associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in Dhaka included perceived social norms, perceived safety of COVID-19 vaccines and trust in them, perceived risk/susceptibility, perceived self-efficacy, perceived positive and negative consequences, perceived action efficacy, perceived severity of COVID-19, access, and perceived divine will. In line with the HBM, beliefs about the disease itself were highly predictive of vaccine acceptance, and some of the strongest statistically-significant (p<0.001) predictors of vaccine acceptance in this population are beliefs around both injunctive and descriptive social norms. Specifically, Acceptors were 3.2 times more likely to say they would be very likely to get a COVID-19 vaccine if a doctor or nurse recommended it, twice as likely to say that most people they know will get a vaccine, and 1.3 times more likely to say that most close family and friends will get a vaccine. The perceived safety of vaccines was found to be important since Non-acceptors were 1.8 times more likely to say that COVID-19 vaccines are not safe at all. Beliefs about one's risk of getting COVID-19 disease and the severity of it were predictive of being a vaccine acceptor: Acceptors were 1.4 times more likely to say that it was very likely that someone in their household would get COVID-19, 1.3 times more likely to say that they were very concerned about getting COVID-19, and 1.3 times more likely to say that it would be very serious if someone in their household contracted COVID-19. Other responses of Acceptors on what makes immunization easier may be helpful in programming to boost acceptance, such as providing vaccination through government health facilities, schools, and kiosks, and having vaccinators maintain proper COVID-19 health and safety protocols. Conclusion An effective behavior change strategy for COVID-19 vaccines uptake will need to address multiple beliefs and behavioral determinants, reducing barriers and leveraging enablers identified in this study. National plans for promoting COVID-19 vaccination should address the barriers, enablers, and behavioral determinants found in this study in order to maximize the impact on COVID-19 vaccination acceptance.",,,,"; Larson, Heidi J./N-1018-2017","Kalam, Md.

Despite efforts to limit the viral transmission, the vaccine is the only solution to ending the pandemic. However, vaccine hesitancy could reduce coverage and hinder herd immunity. Objective: People's intention to get vaccinated can be shaped by several factors, including risk perception which, in turn, is influenced by affect. The present work aimed at investigating how risk perception and some factors associated with the decision to comply with vaccination modulated vaccine acceptance for COVID-19 as compared to seasonal influenza, and how these have varied during the lockdown phases. Method: The study followed the main phases of the emergency in Italy, investigating the intention to get vaccinated against flu and against SARS-CoV-2 (if a vaccine was available) before, during and after the first national lockdown, covering the period from the end of February to the end of June 2020. We investigated the effect of risk perception and other predictors on the decision of getting vaccinated. Results: Compared to the pre-lockdown phase, during the lockdown more people were willing to get vaccinated for COVID-19, regardless of their beliefs about vaccines, and as risk perception increased, so did the intention to accept the vaccine. The acceptance of the flu vaccine increased after the re-opening phase. In addition, the intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19 and against flu increased if there was previous flu vaccination behavior but decreased with increasing doubts about the vaccines in general. Conclusions: The observation of vaccination intentions across the three main phases of the emergency allows important considerations regarding psychological, affect, and demographic determinants useful to tailor public health communication to improve public response to future epidemics.",,,,,"TASSO, Alessandra/0000-0002-3401-9952; LOTTO, LORELLA/0000-0002-0303-3014; girardi, Paolo/0000-0001-8330-9414; CASEROTTI, MARTA/0000-0001-8839-0581",,,,,,,,,,,,0277-9536,1873-5347,,,,MAR,2021,272,,,,,,,,113688,10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.113688,,,,,,,WOS:000624327700020,33485215,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Observational study, based on a cross-sectional (10-20th September 2020) online survey, conducted in a cohort of pwMS' followed at two Portuguese hospitals. The survey included measures to characterize the sample and a questionnaire designed to assess the topics defined for this study. RESULTS: 270 respondents completed the full survey (response rate 58.2%). pwMS greatest concern during the pandemic was an aggravation of MS, especially by patients older than 50 years old. Almost 40% of the patients older than 50 felt that the pandemic negatively affected their MS related medical assistance. Most patients believed they would recover from COVID-19 infection. More than half of the responders feared a MS aggravation if they got COVID-19; this was more pronounced in patients with progressive MS. About 12% of the participants did not want to be vaccinated and almost 40% was unsure. Regarding vaccines in general, almost a third of the participants feared their side effects or MS related complications.

Methods: A nationwide, web-based, self-administered, cross-sectional survey was conducted from 5 to 20 October 2020. The health belief model (HBM) approach was used as a theoretical framework to assess the predictors of acceptance of and WTP for the COVID-19 vaccine. Results: Of 2 480 respondents, 2 451 completed the online survey, yielding a response rate of 98.8%. Participants who participated in the survey had diverse demographics in terms of their location, educational level, occupation type, and family income. Among 2 451 respondents, the majority (89.3%) intended to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Respondents with high perceived benefits of COVID-19 vaccination, such as reduction in worry (OR 5.87; 95% CI 4.39-7.96) and sickness (OR 4.31; 95% CI 3.31-5.62), showed higher intention to receive the vaccine. However, respondents with a high perception of the side effects and barriers to vaccination (OR 0.36; 95% CI 0.25-0.54) and vaccine shortage (OR 0.58; 95% CI 0.41-0.81) showed lower intention to receive the vaccine. The majority (2 162, 88.21%) of respondents were willing to pay an amount of INR: 500-1 000 or USD: 6.81-13.62 for a dose of COVID-19 vaccine, with a median (Q1, Q3) of INR: 500 (500, 1 000) or USD: 6.81 (6.81, 13.62). The higher marginal WTP for the COVID-19 vaccine was influenced by advanced age, marital status, female sex, intermediate educational background, high family income, fair or poor perceived health status, and no affordable barriers. Conclusions: The majority of respondents intended to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.

The aim of our study was to evaluate the immune response to COVID-19 vaccinations in breastfeeding women. Methods: The study included 32 breastfeeding women who, regardless of the study, had decided to be vaccinated. Maternal serum and breast milk samples were simultaneously collected on days 8 +/- 1, 22 +/- 2, 29 +/- 3, and 43 +/- 4 after the first dose of the vaccine.

Available evidence suggests that this preference for domestic vaccines over foreign ones may stem from prejudice against foreign countries, but identifying prejudice-based vaccine preferences is difficult because people also draw inferences about the quality of vaccines based on country of origin. We exploit a unique opportunity provided by the announcement of a viable vaccine by a bi-national venture, BioNTech and Pfizer, to examine the effect of such prejudice on vaccination intentions while controlling for beliefs about the vaccine quality. Methods: We implemented a survey experiment in Germany and the United States (n = 582, 661 respectively) a few days after the BioNTech/Pfizer announcement of a viable vaccine. We randomized the identified company (and country) responsible for the vaccine development between BioNTech (Germany) and Pfizer (U.S.) and asked respondents when they would take said vaccine. Results: In either the German and U.S. samples, we find little evidence that a country of origin of the vaccine makes a difference in when respondents intend to get vaccinated. We also see no evidence that those with a general animus toward the other foreign country would be more biased against a foreign vaccine.

Data were collected from a representative sample of the Spanish population composed of 507 citizens. The proposed model is tested with Partial Least Squares. Empirical testing suggests that attitudes toward the vaccine and moral norms directly determine citizens' behavioral intentions to get vaccinated. These attitudes are mainly explained by perceptions about the benefits and risks associated with the vaccine and, to a lesser extent, by the perceived susceptibility, severity and knowledge of the disease, and each individual's personal health orientation. Contrary to our expectations, perceived social pressures and cues to action do not explain behavioral intentions and attitudes, respectively. The findings from this study also suggest that political ideology indirectly, rather than directly, determines attitudes and behavioral intentions to get vaccinated via increased perceptions of trust and fairness involving the government's decisions regarding the vaccination campaign. Overall, results suggest that reasons for accepting, or rejecting, the vaccine are heterogeneous and more complex than expected.

Yet, many US adults expressed reluctance. Aims The aim of this study was to compare persons willing and unwilling to be vaccinated against COVID-19 and to estimate the effects of vaccination attributes on uptake: proof of vaccination, vaccination setting, effectiveness, duration of immunity, and risk of severe side effects. Method Between 9 and 11 November 2020, 1153 US adults completed a discrete choice experiment (DCE) on Phase 2 of the CDC Vaccination Program (August 2021). Each of its eight choice tasks had three vaccination alternatives and no vaccination for 6 months. An opt-out inflated logit model was estimated to test for respondent differences and attribute effects. Results Respondent demographics were unrelated to one's willingness to be vaccinated (p value 0.533), but those with less education were more likely to be unwilling (p < 0.001). Among those willing, uptake ranged from 61.70 to 97.75%, depending on the vaccination attributes. Effectiveness and safety had the largest effects. Offering proof of vaccination and a choice of setting increased uptake as much as increasing immunity from 3 to 6 months. Conclusions To maximize uptake, the CDC Program should standardize proof of vaccination and offer a choice of setting, instead of a one-size-fits-all approach. If the first-generation vaccines are efficacious, widely available, and free, overall predicted uptake is 68.81% by the end of Phase 2 (August 2021), which is well below the 75-90% needed for herd immunity.

To prevent the spread of COVID-19, countries have implemented diverse policies regarding Non-Pharmaceutical Intervention (NPI) measures. This is because in the first stage countries had limited knowledge about the virus and its contagiousness. Also, there was no effective medication or vaccines. This paper studies the effectiveness of the implemented policies and measures against the deaths attributed to the virus between January and May 2020. Methods Data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control regarding the identified cases and deaths of COVID-19 from 48 countries have been used. Additionally, data concerning the NPI measures related policies implemented by the 48 countries and the capacity of their health care systems was collected manually from their national gazettes and official institutes. Data mining, time series analysis, pattern detection, machine learning, clustering methods and visual analytics techniques have been applied to analyze the collected data and discover possible relationships between the implemented NPIs and COVID-19 spread and mortality. Further, we recorded and analyzed the responses of the countries against COVID-19 pandemic, mainly in urban areas which are over-populated and accordingly COVID-19 has the potential to spread easier among humans. Results The data mining and clustering analysis of the collected data showed that the implementation of the NPI measures before the first death case seems to be very effective in controlling the spread of the disease. In other words, delaying the implementation of the NPI measures to after the first death case has practically little effect on limiting the spread of the disease. The success of implementing the NPI measures further depends on the way each government monitored their application. Countries with stricter policing of the measures seems to be more effective in controlling the transmission of the disease. Conclusions The conducted comparative data mining study provides insights regarding the correlation between the early implementation of the NPI measures and controlling COVID-19 contagiousness and mortality. We reported a number of useful observations that could be very helpful to the decision makers or epidemiologists regarding the rapid implementation and monitoring of the NPI measures in case of a future wave of COVID-19 or to deal with other unknown infectious pandemics. Regardless, after the first wave of COVID-19, most countries have decided to lift the restrictions and return to normal. This has resulted in a severe second wave in some countries, a situation which requires re-evaluating the whole process and inspiring lessons for the future.",,,,"Karampelas, Panagiotis/M-6826-2019; Xylogiannopoulos, Konstantinos/Q-1617-2016","Karampelas, Panagiotis/0000-0003-1684-7612; Xylogiannopoulos, Konstantinos/0000-0003-2376-898X",,,,,,,,,,,,,1471-2458,,,,SEP 1,2021,21,1,,,,,,,1607,10.1186/s12889-021-11251-4,,,,,,,WOS:000692409300001,34470630,,,,,,,,

We argue that game theory and social network models should be used to guide decisions pertaining to vaccination programmes for the best possible results. In the months following the introduction of vaccines, their availability and the human resources needed to run the vaccination programmes have been scarce in many countries. Vaccine hesitancy is also being encountered from some sections of the general public. We emphasize that decision-making under uncertainty and imperfect information, and with only conditionally optimal outcomes, is a unique forte of established game-theoretic modelling.

The present study aimed to assess the Saudi public's intent to get vaccinated against COVID-19 and explore the associated demographic determinants of their intentions as well as the reasons for vaccine hesitancy. A cross-sectional, web-based survey was distributed to public individuals in Saudi Arabia between 25 December 2020 and 15 February 2021. Participants were asked if they were willing to get vaccinated, and the responses, along with demographic data were entered into a multinomial logistic regression model to assess the relative risk ratio (RRR) for responding no or unsure versus yes. Among 3048 participants (60.1% female, 89.5% Saudi), 52.9% intend to get vaccinated, 26.8% were unsure, and 20.3% refused vaccination. Vaccine hesitancy was significantly higher among females (RRR = 2.70, p < 0.0001) and those who had not been recently vaccinated for influenza (RRR = 2.63, p < 0.0001).

They are perceived as the opinion leaders within their communities; therefore, their health-related beliefs and attitudes are deemed important for public health campaigns. This study aimed to investigate the COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy drivers among university students in the Czech Republic. Methods: a cross-sectional study using a self-administered questionnaire was carried out in the weeks before the unrestricted vaccine deployment to Czech adults. The questionnaire had 21 multiple-choice items stratified in 4 categories; demographic characteristics, COVID-19-related anamnesis and influenza vaccine experience, attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination, and the possible drivers of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy suggested by the WHO-SAGE. Results: out of the 1351 included students, 66.8% were females, 84.5% were Czech nationals, and 40.6% enrolled in healthcare programs. The overall COVID-19 vaccine acceptance level was 73.3%, 19.3% of participants were vaccine-resistant, and only 7.4% were vaccine-hesitant. Trust in the pharmaceutical industry, trust in healthcare providers, and perceived knowledge sufficiency predicted higher odds of vaccine acceptance. In contrast, media and social media, personal beliefs, immunity misconception, previous COVID-19 infection, and suspicions about novel vaccines and the local availability predicted higher odds of vaccine hesitancy. Conclusions: The findings of this study predict a fair probability to achieve community immunity (herd immunity) among the target population group. The primary prevention strategies in the Czech Republic need to be culturally sensitive and inclusive for foreign nationals.

This longitudinal study aimed to clarify the association between these and non-monetary incentives to vaccination in the UK. Method Data were collected at three points: (1) before and (2) after the development of a vaccine and (3) after the vaccination programme was underway. At Time 1, participants completed measures of general and COVID-19-specific concerns about vaccination and belief in conspiracy theories. At times 2 and 3, participants reported their intentions whether or not to have the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Those who were hesitant provided qualitative comments about what might change their decision. Results Vaccination hesitancy decreased between times 1 (54%) and 3 (13%). There were small effects of conspiracy beliefs on vaccine hesitancy, but only at time 1. Most concerns and reported incentives were related to safety, although at time 2, incentives included endorsement by trusted public figures. By time 3, only a minority of participants (N = 18) were adamantly against vaccination, stating that nothing would change their minds. Conclusion Vaccination hesitancy declined in the UK during the course of the study. However, concerns about vaccine safety remained and could jeopardise the vaccination programme should any adverse effects be reported. Conspiracy beliefs seem to play only a minor role in hesitancy and may continue to decrease in importance with a successful vaccination programme.

Knowledge about people's lived experiences regarding COVID-19 vaccination can enhance vaccine promotion and increase uptake. Aim: To use COVID-19 vaccine trial participants' experiences to identify key themes in the lived experience of vaccination early in the vaccine approval and distribution process. Methods: We interviewed 31 participants in the Iowa City, Iowa US site of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine phase 3 clinical trial. While trial participation differs from clinical receipt of an approved vaccine in key ways, it offers the first view of people's lived experiences of potentially receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. The trial context is also useful since decision-making about vaccination and medical research participation often involve similar hopes and concerns, and because the public appears to view even approved COVID-19 vaccines as experimental given their novelty. Semi-structured interviews addressed subjects' experiences, including decision-making and telling others about their trial participation. We analyzed verbatim transcripts of these interviews thematically and identified common themes relevant for vaccination decision-making. Results: Participants across demographic groups, including age, sex/gender, race/ethnicity, and political affiliation, described largely similar experiences. Key motivations for participation included ending the pandemic/restoring normalcy, protecting oneself and others, doing one's duty, promoting/modeling vaccination, and expressing aspects of identity like being a helper, career-related motivations, and support of science/vaccines. Participants often felt uniquely qualified to help via trial participation due to personal attributes like health, sex/gender or race/ethnicity. They reported hearing concerns about side effects and the speed and politicization of vaccine development. Participants responded by normalizing and contextualizing side effects, de-politicizing vaccine development, and explaining how the rapid development process was nevertheless safe. Conclusion: These findings regarding participants' reported motivations for trial participation and interactions with concerned others can be incorporated into COVID-19 vaccine promotion messaging aimed at similar populations.

A high proportion of likely or extremely likely to receive the COVID-19 vaccine was reported in Australia (96.4%), China (95.3%) and Norway (95.3%), while a high proportion reported being unlikely or extremely unlikely to receive the vaccine in Japan (34.6%), the U.S. (29.4%) and Iran (27.9%). Males, those with a lower educational level and those of older age expressed a higher level of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Less than two-thirds (59.7%; 95% CI 58.4-61.0) reported only being willing to accept a vaccine with an effectiveness of more than 90%, and 74.5% (95% CI 73.4-75.5) said they would accept a COVID-19 vaccine with minor adverse reactions. A total of 21.0% (95% CI 20.0-22.0) reported not accepting an mRNA vaccine and 51.8% (95% CI 50.3-53.1) reported that they would only accept a COVID-19 vaccine from a specific country-of-origin. Countries from the Southeast Asia region reported the highest proportion of not accepting mRNA technology. The highest proportion from Europe and the Americas would only accept a vaccine produced by certain countries. The foremost important vaccine characteristic influencing vaccine choice is adverse reactions (40.6%; 95% CI 39.3-41.9) of a vaccine and effectiveness threshold (35.1%; 95% CI 33.9-36.4). Conclusions The inter-regional and individual country disparities in COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy highlight the importance of designing an efficient plan for the delivery of interventions dynamically tailored to the local population.

This study aimed to examine how factors related to vaccine characteristics, their social normative influence and convenience of vaccination can affect the public's preference for the uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine in China. Methods An online discrete choice experiment (DCE) survey was administered to a sample of China's general population. Participants were asked to make a series of hypothetical choices and estimate their preference for different attributes of the vaccine. A mixed logit regression model was used to analyse the DCE data. Willingness to pay for each attribute was also calculated. Results Data of 1236 participants who provided valid responses were included in the analysis. There was strong public preference for high effectiveness of the vaccine, followed by long protective duration, very few adverse events and being manufactured overseas. Price was the least important attribute affecting the public preference in selecting the COVID-19 vaccine. Conclusions The strong public preferences detected in this study should be considered when developing COVID-19 vaccination programme in China. The results provide useful information for policymakers to identify the individual and social values for a good vaccination strategy.

So who should be prioritized for vaccination when in the first instance, there will be insufficient supply to meet demand? There is no doubt that health-care workers in all settings should be vaccinated first, but who comes next will be a complex decision based on local epidemiology, societal values, and the ability of the vaccines to prevent both severe disease and to reduce transmission thereby eliciting herd protection. The decision on who to vaccinate should be equitable, highly contextualized, and based on the property of each vaccine. In some settings, the elderly may be prioritized, in others, it may be the population most likely to get infected and responsible for community spread. To support decision-making on who to be prioritized for vaccination requires urgent additional research on the epidemiology of COVID-19; preexisting immunity and who is responsible for transmission in a variety of settings; the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in children and pregnant women; and determining whether COVID-19 vaccines prevent asymptomatic infection and transmission.",,,,,"Russell, Fiona/0000-0002-3077-9639",,,,,,,,,,,,2164-5515,2164-554X,,,,MAY 4,2021,17,5,,,,,1317,1321,,10.1080/21645515.2020.1827882,,OCT 2020,,,,,WOS:000584766000001,33141000,,,,,,,,

Our study aims to fill this gap by investigating whether laypeople have an adequate grasp of what vaccine efficacy means and, if not, which misconceptions and consequences are the most common. To this end, we carried out three online behavioral experiments involving 1800 participants overall. The first, exploratory experiment, with a sample of 600 UK participants, allowed us to document, by means of both an open-ended question and a multiple-choice question, a common misinterpretation of the efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines as the non-incidence rate among the vaccinated. We formally demonstrated that this error leads to a systematic overestimation of the probability of individuals who are vaccinated developing Covid-19. The second experiment confirmed the prevalence of this misinterpretation in a new sample of 600 UK and Italian participants, by means of a slightly different multiple-choice question that included more response options. Finally, in a third experiment, involving another 600 UK and Italian participants, we investigated the behavioral implications of the documented error and showed that it might undermine the general positive attitude toward vaccines as well as the intention to get vaccinated. On the whole, the results of this study reveal a general misunderstanding of vaccine efficacy that may have serious consequences for the perceived benefits of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and, thus, the willingness to be vaccinated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0277-9536,1873-5347,,,,NOV,2021,289,,,,,,,,114273,10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.114273,,,,,,,WOS:000707305900023,34619632,,,,,,,,

The present study aimed to examine whether the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination changed in different COVID-19 epidemic phases in China. Two consecutive surveys were conducted among Chinese adults in March (n = 2058) (severe epidemic phase) and November-December (n = 2013) (well-contained phase, right before the COVID-19 vaccine was conditionally approved) 2020, and 791 respondents were longitudinally followed-up. The attitude, acceptance, and preferences for future COVID-19 vaccination were compared between two epidemic phases. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify influencing factors of acceptance. Among the 791 respondents longitudinally followed, 91.9% in March and 88.6% of them in November-December 2020 would like to get COVID-19 vaccination in China. In March 58.3% wished to get vaccinated immediately, but the proportion declined to 23.0% in November-December 2020, because more respondents wanted to delay vaccination until the vaccine's safety was confirmed. Similar results were found by comparing all respondents from the two cross-sectional surveys in different epidemic phases. The risk perception, attitude for the importance of vaccination against COVID-19, vaccination history, valuing doctor's recommendations, vaccination convenience, or vaccine price in decision-making had impacts on respondents' intention for immediate vaccination. The public acceptance for COVID-19 vaccination in China sustained at a high level in different COVID-19 epidemic phases.

With a health crisis of this magnitude, it is vital to understand the effect of COVID-19-associated containment measures and safety industry strategies in abating public fear and apprehension associated with non-essential travel. Design/methodology/approach - The authors used a sequential transformative design consisting of a (QUAN + Qual) survey to explore the HBM dimensions. The questions in the quantitative part of the survey were disseminated online examine perceptions of the severity and susceptibility of the disease, travel risks and willingness to travel. The questions in the qualitative face-to-face survey examined, how international/cross-border travelers (from Spain and Germany) perceive the benefits and barriers of personal protective behavior and the potential influence of cues to action. Findings - Results suggest that despite potential fear arousal and confusion associated with this infectious disease, people were willing to travel during periodic on-and-off travel restrictions and perceive the benefits of such travel as outweighing barriers like wearing masks, social distancing and other containment measures. Research limitations/implications - The conceptual model enabled the capture of real-time traveler's feelings about the benefits of traveling in the presence of the coronavirus and their perceptions of COVID-19 safety strategies used at destinations. This study adds to the lack of existing knowledge about potential psychological factors influencing travel decisions and behavior, including self-protective behavior. As borders reopen and we progress towards tourism and hospitality recovery, the results of this study can assist organizations, including health officials and governments, by reminding them of the likelihood of residual public fear when planning their COVID-19 safety strategies. Originality/value - Given the scarcity of COVID-19 research on people's travel intentions and behavior following periods of social isolation due to lockdowns and border closures, this study captures sample public perceptions at two stages early in the pandemic. It is the first to apply all of the HBM dimensions with the addition of travel risk as a construct to investigate people's travel intentions and behaviors without vaccinations or treatments and to include cues to action in the investigation.",,,,,"Abraham, Villy/0000-0003-3142-1855",,,,,,,,,,,,2514-9792,2514-9806,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1108/JHTI-12-2020-0235,,SEP 2021,,,,,WOS:000696028100001,,,,,,,,,

Our main results were that the vaccination strategy that prioritized younger generation was better in terms of deaths when a linear relationship between lockdown intensity and acceptable economic loss was assumed.

Methods: We conduct cross-sectional analyses of policy-relevant attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination using survey data of a representative sample of Austrian residents collected by the Austrian Corona Panel Project (ACPP). As outcomes, we examine the individual readiness to get vaccinated, the support for compulsory vaccinations, and the preference for making the vaccine available free of charge. The independent variables include demographics, objective and perceived health risks, and social and political factors. Results: Although there is broad public support for making the vaccine available free of charge, vaccine hesitancy and the opposition to a vaccine mandate are widespread. The protective function of the vaccine for the individual only motivates limited support for vaccinations. Opposition to COVID-19 vaccination also stems from a lack of sense of community and an ongoing politicization of the issue through conspiracy theories and party politics. Conclusion: We propose that overcoming the inherent free-rider problem of achieving sufficiently high vaccination rates poses a potential dilemma for policymakers: Given the politicized nature of the issue, they may find themselves having to choose between making vaccinations compulsory at political costs and a lingering pandemic at high costs for public health and the economy.

Methods: In March 2020, an anonymous cross-sectional survey was conducted online among Chinese adults. The questionnaire collected socio-demographic characteristics, risk perception, the impact of COVID-19, attitudes, acceptance and attribute preferences of vaccines against COVID-19 during the pandemic. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify the influencing factors of vaccination acceptance. Results: Of the 2058 participants surveyed, 1879 (91.3%) stated that they would accept COVID-19 vaccination after the vaccine becomes available, among whom 980 (52.2%) wanted to get vaccinated as soon as possible, while others (47.8%) would delay the vaccination until the vaccine's safety was confirmed. Participants preferred a routine immunization schedule (49.4%) to emergency vaccination (9.0%) or either of them (41.6%). Logistic regression showed that being male, being married, perceiving a high risk of infection, being vaccinated against influenza in the past season, believing in the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccination or valuing doctor's recommendations could increase the probability of accepting COVID-19 vaccination as soon as possible, while having confirmed or suspected cases in local areas, valuing vaccination convenience or vaccine price in decision-making could hinder participants from immediate vaccination. Conclusion: During the pandemic period, a strong demand for and high acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination has been shown among the Chinese population, while concerns about vaccine safety may hinder the promotion of vaccine uptake.

Methods: We used individual-level data from a pandemic-focused study ('COVID Survey'), a prospective cohort study nested within United Kingdom Understanding Society ('Main Survey'). In the week immediately following the announcement of successful testing of the first efficacious inoculation (November/December 2020), data on vaccine intentionality were collected in 11,740 individuals (6702 women) aged 16-95 years. Pre-pandemic scores on general cognitive function, ascertained from a battery of six tests, were captured in 2011/12 wave of the Main Survey. Study members self-reported their intention to take up a vaccination in the COVID-19 Survey. Results: Of the study sample, 17.2% (N = 1842) indicated they were hesitant about having the vaccine. After adjustment for age, sex, and ethnicity, study members with a lower baseline cognition score were markedly more likely to be vaccine hesitant (odds ratio per standard deviation lower score in cognition; 95% confidence interval: 1.76; 1.62, 1.90). Adjustment for mental and physical health plus household shielding status had no impact on these results, whereas controlling for educational attainment led to partial attenuation but the probability of hesitancy was still elevated (1.52; 1.37, 1.67). There was a linear association for vaccine hesitancy across the full range of cognition scores (p for trend: p < 0.0001). Conclusions: Erroneous social media reports might have complicated personal decision-making, leading to people with lower cognitive ability being vaccine-hesitant. With individuals with lower cognition also experiencing higher rates of COVID-19 in studies conducted prior to vaccine distribution, these new findings are suggestive of a potential additional disease burden.",,,,,"Fawns-Ritchie, Chloe/0000-0002-7493-2228; Gale, Catharine/0000-0002-3361-8638",,,,,,,,,,,,0889-1591,1090-2139,,,,AUG,2021,96,,,,,,100,105,,10.1016/j.bbi.2021.05.016,,,,,,,WOS:000677471500012,34022372,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to assess the attitudes towards the prospective COVID-19 vaccines among the general public in Jordan, Kuwait and other Arab countries. We also aimed to assess the association between COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and conspiracy beliefs. This study used an online survey distributed in December 2020, with items assessing conspiracies regarding COVID-19's origin and vaccination. Attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccines were assessed using the Vaccine Conspiracy Belief Scale (VCBS), with higher scores indicating a greater belief in vaccine conspiracy. A total of 3414 respondents completed the survey, the majority being residents of Jordan (n = 2173, 63.6%), Kuwait (n = 771, 22.6%) and Saudi Arabia (n = 154, 4.5%). The acceptance rates for COVID-19 and influenza vaccines were 29.4% and 30.9%, respectively. Males, respondents with higher educational levels and those with histories of chronic disease had higher rates of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Beliefs that COVID-19 vaccines are intended to inject microchips into recipients and that the vaccines are related to infertility were found in 27.7% and 23.4% of respondents, respectively. Higher VCBS scores were found among females, respondents with lower educational levels and respondents relying on social media platforms as the main source of information. The high rates of vaccine hesitancy in Jordan and Kuwait, among other Arab countries, are alarming. They could hinder the proper control of COVID-19 in the region. The harmful effect of COVID-19 misinformation and conspiracy beliefs was manifested in vaccine hesitancy. This may represent a massive obstacle to the successful control of the pandemic. A reliance on social media as the main source of information about COVID-19 vaccines was associated with vaccine hesitancy.

The factors that we varied across treatments were: the stated severity and infectiousness of COVID-19 and the stated source of the risk information (White House or the Centers for Disease Control). We find that 20% of people in the USA intend to decline the vaccine. We find no statistically significant effect on vaccine intentions from the severity of COVID-19. In contrast, we find that the degree of infectiousness of the coronavirus influences vaccine intentions and that inconsistent risk messages from public health experts and elected officials may reduce vaccine uptake.

This study aimed to examine impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on change of influenza vaccination acceptance and identify factors associated with acceptance of potential COVID-19 vaccination. Method: A cross-sectional self-administered anonymous questionnaire survey was conducted among nurses in Hong Kong, China during 26 February and 31 March 2020. Their previous acceptance of influenza vaccination and intentions to accept influenza and COVID-19 vaccination were collected. Their relationship with work-related and other factors were examined using multiple multinomial logistic regressions. Results: Responses from 806 participants were retrieved. More nurses changed from vaccination refusal to hesitancy or acceptance than those changed from acceptance to vaccination hesitancy or refusal (15.5% vs 6.8% among all participants, P < 0.001). 40.0% participants intended to accept COVID-19 vaccination, and those in private sector (OR: 1.67, 95%CI: 1.11-2.51), with chronic conditions (OR: 1.83, 95%CI: 1.22-2.77), encountering with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients (OR: 1.63, 95%CI: 1.14-2.33), accepted influenza vaccination in 2019 (OR: 2.03, 95%CI: 1.47-2.81) had higher intentions to accept it. Reasons for refusal and hesitation for COVID-19 vaccination included suspicion on efficacy, effectiveness and safety, believing it unnecessary, and no time to take it. Conclusion: With a low level of COVID-19 acceptance intentions and high proportion of hesitation in both influenza and COVID-19 vaccination, evidence-based planning are needed to improve the uptake of both vaccinations in advance of their implementation. Future studies are needed to explore reasons of change of influenza vaccination acceptance, look for actual behaviour patterns of COVID-19 vaccination acceptance and examine effectiveness of promotion strategies.

Methods: An electronic survey was administered to 577 caregivers of children aged <= 2 years residing in Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 pandemic curfew. The sources of information on childhood vaccination considered by the caregivers and their influence on the caregivers' decision to delay scheduled vaccination were assessed and statistically analyzed. Results: Most participants (90.8%) were mothers aged 32.6 +/- 5.7 years. Before the pandemic, most caregivers sought information about children's vaccinations personally from the healthcare workers, or trustworthy sources, including the Ministry of Health (MOH), MOH call center 937, and MOH Sehha app. However, during the pandemic, there was a noticeable decrease in the searches for health information through professional consultations (in person and health websites) and a significant increase in the use of social media platforms. Twitter was the most used platform (29.9%) and the use of Snapchat was significantly higher during the lockdown period compared to its use before the pandemic (21.9% vs 17.2%, P < 0.001). The use of social media not only increased the level of fear among the caregivers but also had a negative effect on their decisions about children's vaccinations. Searches on YouTube and Facebook particularly increased the odds of delaying vaccinations by 2.63 times (P = 0.008) and 3.66 times (P = 0.025), respectively. Conclusion: During the pandemic, caregivers' health-information seeking behavior was directed towards social media networking. In Saudi Arabia, YouTube and Facebook, in particular, played an important role in the caregivers' decision-making about childhood vaccinations.

The aim of this study is to identify factors that affect vaccination intention among health science students, by using the health belief model (HBM) as a theoretical framework. Methods: This study was undertaken in April 2021 using a convenience sample strategy among health science students in Tra Vinh University, which is a university in South Vietnam. Participants were required to complete the self-report questionnaire. All data were calculated by using STATA 14 software, to determine the factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, a multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed, along with odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Results: A total of 412 eligible participants were taken part in the study, with a questionnaire response rate of 48.2%, reporting that 77.7% of participants intended to receive a COVID-19 vaccination when available. An overall score of knowledge was 7.8 +/- 1.5 (range 0-10), a positive attitude toward vaccination including perceived susceptibility and severity (3.1 +/- 0.7), perceived benefits (3.1 +/- 0.7) and cues to action (4.0 +/- 0.6). Determinants of willingness to get a COVID-19 vaccination included their field of education, knowledge and factors in HBM model including perceived susceptibility and severity, perceived benefits and cues to action (all p < 0.05). In contrast, perceived barriers had a negative association with the probability of vaccine acceptance (p < 0.05). The study did indicate a number of participants not willing to receive a vaccination due to, mainly, safety (67.4%), development issues (58.7%) and side effects (79.3%).

We collected data on symptoms, antibody titers and vaccination readiness from clinic employees at a municipal clinic who had already been through a COVID-19 infection (asymptomatic to moderate). We also examined the antibody titers for their possible importance as an individual decision-making aid with regard to vaccination. Method: 200 employees of our municipal clinics were included in the study. COVID-19 antibody determination was performed using an ELISA (EUROIMMUN (TM), PerkinElmer, Inc. Company). The participants were given an anonymous questionnaire containing anthropometrical issues, symptoms of the infection and questions concerning the vaccination decision. Finally, the antibody levels were reported to the participants and the attitude towards a vaccination was reevaluated. Results: In all 200 participants who had already gone through a COVID-19 infection, 75 employees were in favor of a vaccination (37.5%), 96 were opposed to vaccination (48%), and 29 were undecided (14.5%). In the different occupational groups, the positive trend in terms of willingness to be vaccinated was highest among physicians and is least among nurses. The antibody results showed considerable variation in titer levels and therefore did not correlate with disease severity in asymptomatic to moderately ill persons. We also observed a pro-vaccination trend with increasing age of the participants. The specificallyasked symptom of cutaneous hyperesthesia during COVID-19 infection occurred in 5% of the participants. Conclusion: In medical personnel who had already suffered from a COVID-19 infection, the willingness to receive a vaccination tends to be highest among physicians, and lowest in nurses, and increases with age. For the vast majority of those affected, knowledge of the antibody titers only reinforces the vaccination decision made beforehand and thus does not contribute to a change in vaccination decision.

To explore vaccine acceptance decisions, we conducted a national survey of 1,000 people from all US states in August of 2020 and a replication in December of 2020. Using a 3 x 3 x 3 factorial experimental design, we estimated the impact of three factors: probability of 1) protection against COVID-19, 2) minor side effects, and 3) a serious adverse reactions. The outcome was respondents' reported likelihood of receiving a vaccine for the coronavirus. Probability of vaccine efficacy (50%, 70%, or 90%) had the largest effect among the three factors. The probability of minor side effects (50%, 75%, 90%) including fever and sore arm, did not significantly influence likelihood of receiving the vaccine. The chances of a serious adverse reaction, such as temporary or permanent paralysis, had a small but significant effect. A serious adverse reaction rate of 1/100,000 was more likely to discourage vaccine use in comparison to rates of 1/million or 1/100 million. All interactions between the factors were nonsignificant. A replication following the announcement that vaccines were 95% effective showed small, but significant increases in the likelihood of taking a vaccine. The main effects and interactions in the model remained unchanged. Expected benefit was more influential in respondents' decision making than expected side effects.

We conducted a systematic review to evaluate disparities in H1N1 vaccine uptake, factors contributing to disparities, and interventions to reduce them. Methods We searched English-language articles in MEDLINE ALL, PsycINFO, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from database inception through May 8, 2020. Observational studies examining H1N1 vaccine uptake by race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, rurality, and disability status in US settings were included. Two reviewers independently assessed study eligibility. Single-reviewer data abstraction was confirmed by a second reviewer. We conducted independent dual quality assessment, and collective strength of evidence assessment. Results We included 21 studies. African American/Black, Latino, and low-socioeconomic status participants had disproportionately lower H1N1 vaccination rates (low- to moderate-strength evidence). However, Latinos were more likely than Whites to intend to be vaccinated, and African American/Blacks and participants with lower-socioeconomic status were just as likely to intend to be vaccinated as their White and higher-socioeconomic status counterparts (low-strength evidence). Vaccine uptake for other groups has been insufficiently studied. Factors potentially contributing to disparities in vaccine uptake included barriers to vaccine access, inadequate information, and concerns about vaccine safety and efficacy. Studies were largely cross-sectional. Many of the studies are a decade old and were conducted in the context of a different pandemic. The categorization of racial and ethnic groups was not consistent across studies and not all groups were well-studied. Discussion Efforts to avoid disparities in COVID-19 vaccination uptake should prioritize vaccine accessibility and convenience in African American/Black, Latino, and low-SES communities; engage trusted stakeholders to share vaccine information; and address concerns about vaccine safety and efficacy.

It is expected that the world will need to battle the COVID-19 pandemic with precautions measures, until an effective vaccine is developed. This paper proposes a real-time COVID-19 detection and monitoring system. The proposed system would employ an Internet of Things (IoTs) framework to collect real-time symptom data from users to early identify suspected coronaviruses cases, to monitor the treatment response of those who have already recovered from the virus, and to understand the nature of the virus by collecting and analyzing relevant data. The framework consists of five main components: Symptom Data Collection and Uploading (using wearable sensors), Quarantine/Isolation Center, Data Analysis Center (that uses machine learning algorithms), Health Physicians, and Cloud Infrastructure. To quickly identify potential coronaviruses cases from this real-time symptom data, this work proposes eight machine learning algorithms, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural Network, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN), Decision Table, Decision Stump, OneR, and ZeroR. An experiment was conducted to test these eight algorithms on a real COVID-19 symptom dataset, after selecting the relevant symptoms. The results show that five of these eight algorithms achieved an accuracy of more than 90 %. Based on these results we believe that real-time symptom data would allow these five algorithms to provide effective and accurate identification of potential cases of COVID-19, and the framework would then document the treatment response for each patient who has contracted the virus.",,,,,"Alzubaidi, Mohammad/0000-0002-8344-623X",,,,,,,,,,,,1746-8094,1746-8108,,,,SEP,2020,62,,,,,,,,102149,10.1016/j.bspc.2020.102149,,,,,,,WOS:000575379700003,32834831,,,,,,,,

RESULTS A total of 13 focus groups were conducted with 70 participants (50 [71.4%] female) who self-identified as American Indian (n = 17 [24.3%]), Black/African American (n = 17 [24.3%]). Filipino/Filipina (n = 11 [15.7%)), Latino/Latina (n = 15 [21.4%]), or Pacific Islander (n = 10 [14.3%]). A total of 39 participants (55.7%) were residents from high-poverty zip codes, and 34 (48.6%) were essential workers. The resulting themes included policy implications for equitable vaccine distribution: contextual influences (unclear and unreliable information, concern for inequitable access or differential treatment, references to mistrust from unethical research studies, accessibility and accommodation barriers, eligibility uncertainty, and fears of politicization or pharmaceutical industry influence); social and group influences (inadequate exposure to trusted messengers or information, altruistic motivations, medical mistrust, and desire for autonomy); and vaccination-specific influences (need for vaccine evidence by subpopulation, misconceptions on vaccine development, allocation ambiguity, vaccination safety preferences, the importance of perceiving vaccine equity, burden of vaccine scheduling, cost uncertainty, and desire for practitioner recommendation). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this qualitative study, participants reported a number of factors that affected their vaccine decision-making, including concern for inequitable vaccine access. Participants endorsed policy recommendations and strategies to promote vaccine confidence. These results suggest that support of informed deliberation and attainment of vaccine equity will require multifaceted, multilevel policy approaches that improve COVID-19 vaccine knowledge, enhance trust, and address the complex interplay of sociocultural and structural barriers to vaccination.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2574-3805,,,,,SEP 30,2021,4,9,,,,,,,e2127582,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.27582,,,,,,,WOS:000702484500007,34591103,,,,,,,,

Developing vaccination strategies that are modelled on what people want could further increase uptake. Methods and findings To inform COVID-19 vaccine distribution strategies that are aligned with public preferences we conducted a discrete choice experiment among the US public (N = 2,895) between March 15 to March 22, 2021. We applied sampling weights, evaluated mean preferences using mixed logit models, and identified latent class preference subgroups. On average, the public prioritized ease, preferring single to two dose vaccinations (mean preference: -0.29; 95%CI: -0.37 to -0.20), vaccinating once rather than annually (mean preference: -0.79; 95%CI: -0.89 to -0.70) and reducing waiting times at vaccination sites. Vaccine enforcement reduced overall vaccine acceptance (mean preference -0.20; 95%CI: -0.30 to -0.10), with a trend of increasing resistance to enforcement with increasing vaccine hesitancy. Latent class analysis identified four distinct preference phenotypes: the first prioritized inherent vaccine features (46.1%), the second were concerned about vaccine service delivery (8.8%), a third group desired social proof of vaccine safety and were susceptible to enforcement (13.2%), and the fourth group were indifferent to vaccine and service delivery features and resisted enforcement (31.9%). Conclusions This study identifies several critical insights for the COVID-19 public health response. First, identifying preference segments is essential to ensure that vaccination services meet the needs of diverse population subgroups. Second, making vaccination easy and promoting autonomy by simplifying services and offering the public choices (where feasible) may increase uptake in those who remain deliberative. And, third vaccine mandates have the potential to increase vaccination rates in susceptible groups but may simultaneously promote control aversion and resistance in those who are most hesitant.",,,,,"Tram, Khai Hoan/0000-0003-1129-7674",,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,,2021,16,8,,,,,,,e0256394,10.1371/journal.pone.0256394,,,,,,,WOS:000686828600068,34415928,,,,,,,,

Findings From a Survey and Roundtable Workshop,PHARMACOECONOMICS,,,,,,,,,,,,"Background To date, health technology assessment (HTA) agencies have not been at the forefront of decision making regarding the adoption of interventions for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Instead, policymakers have prioritised rapid action in response to the pandemic emergency, with no assessment of value for money. As COVID-19 vaccination coverage increases and healthcare systems begin to recover, HTA agencies will be expected to assess technologies for COVID-19. Objective We aimed to identify the key challenges when assessing therapeutic and diagnostic technologies for COVID-19, from the perspective of HTA agencies, and identify whether there is a case for novel HTA methods and/or processes to address them. Methods We used a mixed-methods approach, by conducting an online survey of HTA agencies, to collect data about the challenges faced when assessing or planning to assess diagnostic and therapeutic technologies for COVID-19. The online survey was followed by a 'roundtable' workshop of HTA agencies' representatives to discuss the results and to elaborate on their responses. Results We received 21 completed surveys (response rate of 45%) and 11 of the respondents joined the roundtable discussion. Five themes emerged from the responses: assessing clinical effectiveness (44%), assessing cost effectiveness (19%), practical (19%), political (11%), and decision making (11%) challenges. At the roundtable, attendees elaborated on the challenges and identified two additional themes: how HTA agencies have responded to the pandemic to date, and how their role might change over time. Conclusion HTA agencies face both methodological and logistical challenges when assessing or planning to assess technologies for COVID-19. An interim best-practice HTA framework to address the key challenges would be valuable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1170-7690,1179-2027,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s40273-021-01097-4,,OCT 2021,,,,,WOS:000706082400002,34635993,,,,,,,,

The investigators conducted a survey assessing perceptions of the vaccine among patients with cancer. A total of 111 patients were asked to complete a questionnaire evaluating their knowledge about the vaccine, their readiness to be vaccinated and the determinants of their decision. Most (61.3%) patients considered themselves more susceptible to COVID-19 than the general population. Television, radio and newspapers were the major sources of information about the vaccine. The majority of patients (55%) were ready to be vaccinated and 14.4% refused the vaccine. The main reason for refusal was incompatibility with patients' disease or treatment. Better communication with patients is needed to decrease vaccine hesitancy. Aims: This paper reports the results of a survey assessing the acceptance of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine among patients with cancer.

Gender, age, belief in the second wave, perceived personal risk, germ aversion, and trust in science were all found to be significant positive predictors of the intent to adhere to non-pharmacological COVID-19 recommendations, with the belief in the second wave, germ aversion, and trust in science being the most important ones. On the other hand, only the belief in the second wave and trust in science were significant positive predictors of the intent to adhere to pharmacological COVID-19 recommendations (i.e., to vaccinate).

Countries prioritize vaccinating health workers against COVID-19 because of their susceptibility to the virus. However, the acceptability of the vaccine varies across populations. Thus, this study aimed to determine the health care worker's intentions to accept the COVID-19 vaccine and its associated factors in southwestern Ethiopia, 2021. Methods A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted among health care workers in public hospitals in southwestern Ethiopia from March 15 to 28, 2021. A simple random sampling method was used to select 405 participants from each hospital. Data were collected using self-administered questionnaires. Descriptive statistics, such as frequency and percentage, were calculated. Multivariable logistic regression was also performed to identify factors associated with health care worker's intention to accept the COVID-19 vaccine. Statistically significant variables were selected based on p-values (<0.05) and the adjusted odds ratio was used to describe the strength of association with 95% confidence intervals. Result Among the respondents, 48.4% [95% CI: 38.6, 58.2] of health care workers intended to accept COVID-19. Intention to accept COVID-19 vaccination was significantly associated with physicians (AOR = 9.27, 95% CI: 1.27-27.32), professionals with a history of chronic illness (AOR = 4.07, 95% CI: 2.02-8.21), perceived degree of risk of COVID-19 infection (AOR = 4.63, 95% CI: 1.26-16.98), positive attitude toward COVID-19 prevention (AOR = 6.08, 95% CI: 3.39-10.91) and good preventive practices (AOR = 2.83, 95% CI: 1.58-5.08). Conclusion In this study, the intention of health care workers to accept the COVID-19 vaccine was low.

Details about the structure and number of susceptible, infectious, and recovered/vaccinated individuals from the contact layer are simultaneously transferred to the information layer. The ever-growing wealth of information that is becoming available about the COVID virus was modelled at each individual level by a simplified proxy predictor of the amount of disease spread. Each informed individual, a node in a heterogeneous graph, makes a decision about vaccination motivated by their benefit. The obtained results showed that disease information type, global or local, has a significant impact on an individual vaccination decision. A number of different scenarios were investigated. The scenarios showed that in the case of the stronger impact of globally broadcasted disease information, individuals tend to vaccinate in larger numbers at the same time when the infection has already spread within the population. If individuals make vaccination decisions based on locally available information, the vaccination rate is uniformly spread during infection outbreak duration. Prioritising elderly population vaccination leads to an increased number of infected cases and a higher reduction in mortality. The developed model accuracy allows the precise targeting of vaccination order depending on the individuals' number of social contacts.

Background As COVID-19 vaccine becomes available worldwide, attention is being directed to community vaccine uptake, to achieve population-wide immunity. A number of factors have been reported to influence vaccine intention. Methods Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a systematic search of COVID-19 vaccination intention related literature published on or before 31 December 2020 from seven databases was undertaken. Results Thirty articles were included in this systematic review. Overall COVID-19 vaccination intention during the first year of the pandemic ranged from 27.7% to 93.3%. Findings highlighted that socio-demographic differences, perceptions of risk and susceptibility to COVID-19 and vaccine attributes influenced vaccination intention. Healthcare professionals particularly, nurses have higher vaccine hesitancy reportedly due to concerns regarding vaccine safety and efficacy and mistrust of health authorities. Negative information about COVID-19 vaccines in the social media and low confidence in the health system were associated with lower acceptability among the community. Interestingly, cumulative increase in COVID-19 caseloads of countries over time was not associated with vaccination intention. Conclusions The significant variability in vaccine intention rates worldwide would hamper efforts to achieve immunity against COVID-19. Nurses' concerns about vaccine safety and efficacy need to be addressed to increase vaccine acceptance and maximise their influence on vaccination decision in the community. As misinformation through social media negatively impacts vaccination uptake, authoritative and reliable information on vaccine attributes, disease risks and vaccination benefits are needed.

SARS-CoV-2 appears to be highly transmissible and could rapidly spread in residential care homes. Objective: The work undertaken aimed to estimate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of viral detection point-of-care tests for detecting SARS-CoV-2 compared with laboratory-based tests in the setting of a hypothetical care home facility for elderly residents. Perspective/setting: The perspective was that of the NHS in 2020. The setting was a hypothetical care home facility for elderly residents. Care homes with en suite rooms and with shared facilities were modelled separately. Methods: A discrete event simulation model was constructed to model individual residents and simulate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 once it had entered the residential care facility. The numbers of COVID-19-related deaths and critical cases were recorded in addition to the number of days spent in isolation. Thirteen strategies involving different hypothetical SARS-CoV-2 tests were modelled. Recently published desirable and acceptable target product profiles for SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care tests and for hospital-based SARS-CoV-2 tests were modelled. Scenario analyses modelled early release from isolation based on receipt of a negative SARS-CoV-2 test result and the impact of vaccination. Incremental analyses were undertaken using both incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and net monetary benefits. Results: Cost-effectiveness results depended on the proportion of residential care facilities penetrated by SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care tests with desirable target product profiles appear to have high net monetary benefit values. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care tests with acceptable target product profiles had low net monetary benefit values because of unnecessary isolations. The benefit of allowing early release from isolation depended on whether or not the facility had en suite rooms. The greater the assumed efficacy of vaccination, the lower the net monetary benefit values associated with SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care tests, when assuming that a vaccine lowers the risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2. Limitations: There is considerable uncertainty in the values for key parameters within the model, although calibration was undertaken in an attempt to mitigate this. Some degree of Monte Carlo sampling error persists because of the timelines of the project. The example care home simulated will also not match those of decision-makers deciding on the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of introducing SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care tests. Given these limitations, the results should be taken as indicative rather than definitive, particularly the cost-effectiveness results when the relative cost per SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care test is uncertain. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care tests have considerable potential for benefit for use in residential care facilities, but whether or not this materialises depends on the diagnostic accuracy and costs of forthcoming SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care tests. Future work: More accurate results would be obtained when there is more certainty on the diagnostic accuracy of and the reduction in time to test result associated with SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care tests when used in the context of residential care facilities, the proportion of care home penetrated by SARS-CoV-2 and the levels of immunity once vaccination is administered.

Additionally, a lower percentage (18.1%) were willing to allow their children to participate. Motivators that encourage participation were the desire to return to normal life (73.2%), followed by the desire to help in finding a treatment for COVID-19 infection (68.1%). Barriers towards the participation were not wanting to be challenged by the virus (54.7%), fear (40.7%), lack of time (40.4%), and mistrust in pharmaceutical companies (38.9%). Finally, results showed that higher educational level was associated with lower willingness to participate (P=0.001), whereas having a previous participation in clinical studies is associated with a significantly higher willingness to participate in COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials (P<0.001). Conclusion: A good portion of Jordanians are positive regarding participation in clinical studies of COVID-19 vaccine.

Agnotology has taught us that in such times science denialism and vaccination scepticism can gain a foothold and discourage the undiscerning and the uninformed from receiving the treatment and prophylactic public health measures that are essential to community health and safety. When health practitioners endorse such attitudes they pose a serious risk to not only their patients but the whole community. This requires a robust response from health practitioner regulators, disciplinary tribunals and courts. This column identifies such a sensible and proportionate response from the Irish High Court in Medical Council v Waters [2021] IEHC 252 when a general practitioner's registration to practise was suspended for promoting such views.

Early detection of Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was associated with survival in patients hospitalized with COVID 19. Early antibody levels predicted outcome in our study. This result is consistent with the benefit of therapeutic antibodies early in the course of COVID 19 disease. With additional study, early antibody levels may be helpful in deciding on appropriate therapies. Neutralizing antibodies to the SARS CoV-2 spike proteins have been issued Emergency Use Authorizations and are a likely mechanism of vaccines to prevent COVID-19. However, benefit of treatment with monoclonal antibodies has only been observed in clinical trials in outpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19 but not in patients who are hospitalized and/or have advanced disease. To address this observation, we evaluated the timing of anti SARS-CoV-2 antibody production in hospitalized patients with the use of a highly sensitive multiplexed bead-based immunoassay allowing for early detection of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. We found significantly lower levels of antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in the first week after symptom onset in patients who expired as compared to patients who were discharged. We also developed a model to characterize the relationship between each patient's individual antibody level trajectory and eventual COVID 19 outcome which can be adapted into a prediction model with more data.",,,,,"Kozlowski, Steven/0000-0002-7240-3605; Lehtimaki, Mari/0000-0002-7869-9064",,,,,,,,,,,,1553-7366,1553-7374,,,,JUL,2021,17,7,,,,,,,e1009766,10.1371/journal.ppat.1009766,,,,,,,WOS:000677725200002,34280244,,,,,,,,

Multiple Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) approach effectively handles this vague information. Furthermore, with the support of the Intuitionistic Fuzzy Soft Set (IFSS), the entries under the new extension of the Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluation-II (PROMETHEE-II) is suggested for Preference Ranking Structure. The concept of intuitionistic fuzzy soft sets is parametric in nature. IFSS suggests how to exploit an intuitionistic ambiguous input from a decision-maker to make up for any shortcomings in the information provided by the decider. The weight of the inputs is calculated under the Intuitionistic Fuzzy Weighted Average (IFWA) operator, the Simply Weighted Intuitionistic Fuzzy Average (SWIFA) operator, and the Simply Intuitionistic Fuzzy Average (SIFA) operator.

A cross-sectional study was carried out among students at Astana Medical University (N = 888, Kazakhstan) in March 2021. Only 2% of the participants were currently vaccinated, and 22.4% showed the potential for COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. The following barriers were the most important in COVID-19 vaccine acceptance: concern about possible side effects of vaccination (73%), absence of sufficient evidence on the effectiveness and safety (57%) and quality (42%), the belief that the immune system will cope with COVID-19 even without vaccination (38%), and lack of trust in the effectiveness of vaccination against COVID-19 (33%). Moreover, this study identified the following factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance: contextual influences (e.g., communication and media environment, socio-demographic factors, vaccination policies, and perception of the pharmaceutical industry), individual and group influences (e.g., personal experience with vaccination, attitudes about health and prevention, trust in the health system and providers, perceived risk), and specific issues on COVID-19 vaccine/vaccination (e.g., choice of vaccine can reduce vaccine hesitancy by 30%). A developed 12-item 6-factor model of COV-VHS showed good validity and reliability. In conclusion, there was a low-level potential for COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among medical students in Kazakhstan.

The responsible authorities were of the opinion - and still are e.g. in Sweden - that it is sufficient enough to protect particularly vulnerable persons such as the elderly or people with pre-existing conditions. The idea behind this is that as soon as 60 to 70 percent of the population is infected with a pathogen, a so-called herd immunity has developed. However, the increasing numbers of deaths and modelling studies showed the expected overload of the hospitals. Therefore, most countries decided for a temporary lockdown with the exception of Sweden.

Residual blood samples were collected for serology testing over 5-day periods monthly from June 2020 to January 2021 from six clinical laboratories across the province of Alberta, Canada. A total of 93,993 individual patient samples were tested with a SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antibody assay with positives confirmed using a spike antibody assay. Population-adjusted SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositivity was 0.92% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.91 to 0.93%) shortly after the first COVID-19 wave in June 2020, increasing to 4.63% (95% CI: 4.61 to 4.65%) amid the second wave in January 2021. There was no significant difference in seropositivity between males and females (1.39% versus 1.27%; P=0.11). Ages with highest seropositivity were 0 to 9 years (2.71%, 95% CI: 1.64 to 3.78%) followed by 20 to 29 years (1.58%, 95% CI: 1.12 to 2.04%), with the lowest rates seen in those aged 70 to 79 (0.79%, 95% CI: 0.65 to 0.93%) and.80 (0.78%, 95% CI: 0.60 to 0.97%). Compared to the seronegative group, seropositive patients inhabited geographic areas with lower household income ($87,500 versus $97,500; P<0.001), larger household sizes, and higher proportions of people with education levels of secondary school or lower, as well as immigrants and visible minority groups (all P<0.05). A total of 53.7% of seropositive individuals were potentially undetected cases with no prior positive COVID-19 nucleic acid test (NAAT). Antibodies were detectable in some patients up to 9 months post positive NAAT result. This seroprevalence study will continue to inform public health decisions by identifying at-risk demographics and geographical areas. IMPORTANCE Using SARS-CoV-2 serology testing, we assessed the proportion of people in Alberta, Canada (population 4.4 million) positive for COVID-19 antibodies, indicating previous infection, during the first two waves of the COVID-19 pandemic (prior to vaccination programs). Linking these results with sociodemographic population data provides valuable information as to which groups of the population are more likely to have been infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus to help facilitate public health decision-making and interventions. We also compared seropositivity data with previous COVID-19 molecular testing results. Absence of antibody and molecular testing were highly correlated (95% negative concordance). Positive antibody correlation with a previous positive molecular test was low, suggesting the possibility of mild/asymptomatic infection or other reasons leading individuals from seeking medical attention. Our data highlight that the true estimate of population prevalence of COVID-19 is likely best informed by combining data from both serology and molecular testing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2165-0497,,,,,SEP,2021,9,1,,,,,,,e00291-21,10.1128/Spectrum.00291-21,,,,,,,WOS:000703076500061,34406813,,,,,,,,

The project was subsequently extended to ten Italian Regions. This led to the creation of the VaccinarSi Network, whose websites are publicly owned. The aim of this work was to present the framework of the websites of the VaccinarSi Network and to analyse user behaviour in the pre-COVID-19-era (dating from each website's publication until 31 January 2020) and in the COVID-19-era (from 1 February 2020 to 31 January 2021). Some metrics such as the number of visits to the site (sessions, number of users and average session duration), user behaviour (pages viewed, bounce rate and organic search) and the session acquisition path (direct traffic, referrals and social traffic) were searched, extrapolated and processed with Google Analytics. Qualitative and normally distributed quantitative variables were summarised with their absolute (relative) frequencies and means. Statistical differences between the means of the two periods were evaluated through paired t-test. A two-tailed p-value less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. When the total values recorded over the period were compared, an overall increase in metrics was observed-the number of individual users, visits and individual pageviews rose in a statistically significant way. Our study aimed to highlight how combining disciplines such as health education and digital communication via Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) represents the best strategy to support citizens. This approach gives them the tools to become independent and responsible players that are capable of voluntarily and consciously choosing to adhere to vaccination programs.

However, in the United States, the politicization of the vaccine approval process, including which public figures are endorsing it, could undermine beliefs about its safety and efficacy and willingness to receive it. Using a pair of randomized survey experiments, we show that announcing approval of a COVID-19 vaccine one week before the presidential election compared to one week after considerably reduces both beliefs about its safety and efficacy and intended uptake. However, endorsement by Dr. Anthony Fauci increases confidence and uptake among all partisan subgroups. Further, an endorsement by Dr. Fauci increased uptake and confidence in safety even if a vaccine receives pre-election approval. The results here suggest that perceptions of political influence in COVID-19 vaccine approval could significantly undermine the viability of a vaccine as a strategy to end the pandemic.

Closing educational institutes, stay at home orders, campaigns for emphasis on vaccination, usage of medical mask and frequently sanitizing hands, etc. are the endeavors made by the authorities to decrease the number of cases in the country. In this regard, the contribution aims to help the decision-makers to identify a potential prevention strategy, based on public acceptance and intervention effectiveness. To achieve this objective, feasible judgments of professionals from three different sectors are brought together through meetings. Opinions, based on ten criteria, are recorded in linguistic form for prioritizing six alternatives. The linguistic terms are then evaluated and manipulated by entailing triangular fuzzy numbers and a group multi-criteria decision making (GMCDM) approach. After using the fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (F-AHP) for the complex decisions, the fuzzy VI.sekriterijumsko KOmpromisno Rangiranje method (F-VIKOR) is utilized to attain the closest ideal stratagem. Consequently, through the ranking orders of defuzzified scores, intuitive preference of compromise solutions is suggested. The tactic gaining more priority with respect to the group utility to the majority and F-VIKOR index is complete lockdown for the short term. Furthermore, a comparison analysis is also added in the discussion to verify the attained prioritized outcomes. This comparative study is carried out through the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), which evidently produces the same preference of alternatives.

Recently, fear of vaccine side effects created widespread concern and paused global vaccination efforts. Many studies find that how medical risks are framed and communicated can influence individuals' perceptions and behavior, yet there is little evidence on how the communication of COVID-19 vaccine side-effect risks influences vaccine intentions. The primary objective of our study is to evaluate how the framing of vaccine-side effect risks impacts individuals' vaccine intentions and perceptions of vaccine safety. The study will assess the impact of 3 dimensions of side-effect framing: 1. Qualitative risk labels: Determine whether attaching a qualitative risk label (e.g. adding very low risk next to the actual numerical risk) impacts individuals' willingness to take a vaccine and their perceptions of its safety. 2. Comparison groups: Determine how framing side-effect risks in comparison to other causes of mortality (COVID-19 mortality and motor vehicle mortality) impacts individuals' willingness to take a vaccine and their perceptions of its safety. 3. How the comparison risks are presented: Determine whether comparisons to other causes of mortality are presented on an absolute or relative scale impacts individuals' willingness to take a vaccine and their perceptions of its safety. Secondarily, we will also randomize a subset of individuals to receive the status-quo framing, where the vaccine side-effect risks are presented like how they were presented in the media. We will then compare vaccine intentions and perceptions of vaccine safety between the status-quo and the pooled intervention group samples to provide some insight into how harmful the status-quo framing was. Ultimately, we believe that our results will provide the some of the first experimental evidence on how the communication of COVID-19 vaccine risks may impact the public's willingness to be vaccinated and can inform future efforts to increase vaccination rates. Trial design: Our study is an online-based randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate the effect of different vaccine side-effect framings on COVID-19 vaccine intentions and perceived safety for a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine. Using a factorial design, we will experimentally assess the impact of 3 risk framing strategies, varying whether the risk is presented: (1) with a qualitative label, (2) whether the risk is presented with a comparison risk, and (3) for comparison cases, whether the comparison is in absolute or relative terms. We will also randomize a portion of respondents to a status quo framing where the side effect risk mimics the media's communication in early April 2021. Participants: This will be an online study setting. We will use Prolific to recruit participants and host our study on the Gorilla platform. To be eligible, participants must be 18 years old or over (male, female, or other), have current residence in the US or UK, and be able to speak English. Participants will be excluded from the study if they do not meet our inclusion criteria. Intervention and comparator: Our study content will consist of five pages presented to individuals online. Page 1 will explain the purpose of the study and contain the consent information. Page 2 will contain basic sociodemographic questions, including participants' age, sex, and schooling level. Page 3 will set up the experiment by telling individuals that we will describe a hypothetical new COVID-19 vaccine and that we would like to know how likely they would be to take the vaccine and how safe they think the vaccine is. On this page, we will also encourage individuals to respond truthfully and remind them that their answers are confidential and cannot be linked back to any personal identifying information. Page 4 will be the main experimental slide, where we will present individuals with information on the vaccine, varying how the vaccination risk is communicated based on which experimental framing arm they are randomized to. We will factorially randomize across the following factors in the following order (separately by country). First, we will determine whether individuals are randomized to the status quo framing, or the intervention framings (1500 respondents to the status quo, and 4500 to the intervention). Among those randomized to the intervention framing, we will randomize (equal allocation) whether the side effect is presented without a comparison, with a comparison to COVID-19 mortality, or with a comparison to motor vehicle mortality. We will then factorially randomize (equal allocation) whether the risk is presented with a qualitative risk label or not (e.g. very low risk). To ensure that the factors are independent of one another, we will do this by randomizing individuals to the risk labels within strata of the comparison group factor. Lastly, among those randomized to the comparison group, we will factorially randomize whether the risk is presented as an absolute or relative comparison. As previously, we will ensure independence by doing this randomization within strata of comparison group*risk labelling. This entire design is visualized in the full protocol. The experimental text for each arm is: Arm 1: With regards to side effects, so far 8 individuals have developed potentially life-threatening blood clots. This is among the approximately 7 million adults that have received the vaccine so far. Arm 2: With regards to side effects, 1 out of 100,000 vaccinated individuals may develop serious blood clots.

As a reference, this is nearly 1/4th of the risk of dying in a motor vehicle accident based on data from the past year. The risk information will be presented on a single page along with the two main outcome questions. Lastly, for individuals that reported that they are unlikely or unsure about whether they would take the vaccine, the final page will ask them their reason (question based on a recently published study of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy). Main outcomes: Our primary outcome is individuals' willingness to take the hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine. We will measure this outcome by asking, How likely would you be to take this vaccine? allowing individuals to choose from a four-point Likert response of Unlikely, Unsure leaning towards unlikely, Unsure leaning towards likely, Very likely. This outcome variable, including the categories and phrasing, is based on a recently published study on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy conducted by researchers with the Vaccine Hesitance Project at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Our secondary outcome is individuals' perceived safety of the vaccine. We will assess this outcome by asking individuals, How safe do you feel this vaccine is? allowing them to choose answers ranging from 1-10 where 1 is extremely unsafe, and 10 is extremely safe. Both outcomes will be measured at the time of the questionnaire. Participants can take up to 45 min to complete the questions but will not be able to go back and change their responses after submitting their questionnaire. Randomization: Using a web-based randomization algorithm, Gorilla will randomly allocate participants to each of the experimental arms. Gorilla allows for two randomization options - independent randomization of each individual based on a probability draw and balanced randomization, which randomizes without replacement such that among groups of respondents a fixed proportion will end up in each experimental arm. We will use the balanced randomization option to ensure that our experimental arms are balanced. Participants will be randomized based on the allocations described above. Blinding: Because Prolific handles the interaction between the study investigators and participants, the participants will be completely anonymous to the study investigators. The outcome measures will be self-reported and submitted anonymously. All persons in the study team will be blinded to the group allocation. Numbers to be randomized: We will randomize 6000 participants per country for a total sample of 12000 individuals. Trial status: The protocol version number is 1.0 and the date is July 14, 2021. Recruitment is expected to begin on 26 July 2021 and end by August 10, 2021. Full protocol: The full protocol is attached as an additional file, accessible from the Trials website (Full_Protocol_20Jul2021) In the interest of expediting dissemination of this material, the familiar formatting has been eliminated; this Letter serves as a summary of the key elements of the full protocol.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1745-6215,,,,SEP 6,2021,22,1,,,,,,,592,10.1186/s13063-021-05484-2,,,,,,,WOS:000693248500008,34488843,,,,,,,,

The basic reproduction number (R0) is either ratio or rate or the basic reproductive rate. This dimensionless number was calculated in the past to describe the contagiousness or transmissibility of infectious agents for many communicable diseases. Its importance in the context of COVID-19 is not less, it tells us about the public health measures to be undertaken for disease prevention, and how the transmission of COVID-19 will be affected or eliminated. R0 is affected by several biological, sociobehavioral, and environmental factors which decide agent transmission. R0 is estimated by using complex mathematical models, the results of which are easily distorted, misjudged, and misused. R0 is not a biological constant for an agent or pathogen, it is a rate over time. It can measure the disease severity and also gives an estimate about the herd immunity required for the reversal of epidemic. R0 cannot be altered through vaccination campaigns though it can tell us about the relationship between the population's immune status and epidemic curve. Modeled R0 values are dependent on the model structures and assumptions made. Some R0 values reported in the scientific literature are likely outdated as assumptions are frequently changing in the current pandemic.

Countries will face substantial health, economic and social burden deriving from vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) such as influenza, pneumonia and herpes zoster in older adults. It will be essential that countries utilize several public health strategies, including immunization. Understanding the different approaches countries have taken on adult immunization could help provide future learnings and technical support for adult vaccines within life-course immunization strategies. In this study, we describe the priorities and approaches that underlie adult immunization decision-making and implementation processes in 32 high-and-middle-income countries and two territories (34 countries) who recommend adult vaccines in their national schedule. We conducted an archetype analysis based on a subset of two dozen indicators abstracted from a larger database. The analysis was based on a mixed-methods study, including results from 120 key informant interviews in six countries and a landscape review of secondary data from 34 countries. We found four distinct archetypes: disease prevention-focused; health security-focused; evolving adult focus; and, child-focused and cost-sensitive. The highest performing countries belonged to the disease prevention-focused and health security archetypes, although there was a range of performance within each archetype. Considering common barriers and facilitators of decision-making and implementation of adult vaccines within a primary archetype could help provide a framework for strategies to support countries with similar needs and approaches. It can also help in developing context-specific policies and guidance, including for countries prioritizing adult immunization programs in light of COVID-19. Further research may be beneficial to further refine archetypes and expand the understanding of what influences success within them. This can help advance policies and action that will improve vaccine access for older adults and build a stronger appreciation of the value of immunization amongst a variety of stakeholders.

The main objective of this study was to understand the attitudes and concerns of healthcare workers (HCWs) towards the upcoming COVID-19 vaccine, whether their decision was influenced by their history of taking the seasonal influenza vaccine, and factors that influence the acceptance of the upcoming COVID-19 vaccine. This was a cross-sectional study conducted in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. We selected and surveyed 356 HCWs via an electronic self-administered questionnaire. A total of 61.16% of HCWs were willing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, and 55.9% of them had received the seasonal influenza vaccine in the preceding year (2019-2020). The strongest predictors for taking the COVID-19 vaccine were the HCWs' belief that the COVID-19 vaccine would be safe, needed even for healthy people, that all HCWs should be vaccinated against COVID-19, and that HCWs will have time to take the vaccine. Being female, being middle aged, having <5 years of work experience, having no fear of injections, and being a non-smoker were predictive factors for taking the upcoming COVID-19 vaccine. No associations were found between the intention to take the COVID-19 vaccine and a history of taking the seasonal influenza vaccine.",,,,"Baghdadi, Leena R./ABC-8527-2020","Baghdadi, Leena R./0000-0003-3315-6266; Abuhaimed, Alanoud/0000-0002-9594-1924",,,,,,,,,,,,,2076-393X,,,,MAY,2021,9,5,,,,,,,465,10.3390/vaccines9050465,,,,,,,WOS:000654611200001,34066397,,,,,,,,

Social, economic, and psychological determinants of COVID-19 testing decisions",PLOS ONE,,,,,,,,,,,,"Background The efficacy of testing and tracing programs to reduce COVID-19 transmission hinges not only on widespread access to testing, but also on the public's willingness to participate in them. To the extent that testing intentions are patterned by social determinants of health, this constitutes an understudied mechanism of disparities in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. Design Using data from a representative household probability sample, the Person to Person Health Interview Study (n = 935), sociodemographic, economic, and psychological determinants of testing considerations were evaluated across six domains: treatment affordability, ability to work if positive, hospital effectiveness, symptom severity, proximity to infected, and risk of transmitting to others. Results Findings demonstrated significant differences in testing motivations across race/ethnicity, education level, socioeconomic status, and worry about self and loved ones. Notably, Black (p<0.01) and Latino (p<0.05) respondents and those experiencing financial strain (p<0.001) were disproportionately likely to indicate that resource factors would influence their decision to get tested. Desire to reduce transmission and concern about proximity to the infected were reported among those who expressed COVID-19 worries (p<0.001). Conclusion Public health efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic must address social, economic, and psychological factors that enable and constrain individual behavior. Increasing access to preventative interventions and technologies, including vaccines, is unlikely to markedly reduce morbidity and mortality without effective messaging and economic support to improve uptake in vulnerable populations.",,,,,"Perry, Brea/0000-0001-7869-7168; Railey, Ashley/0000-0002-0763-5397",,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,JUL 14,2021,16,7,,,,,,,e0252658,10.1371/journal.pone.0252658,,,,,,,WOS:000678119300001,34260602,,,,,,,,

The human cost of COVID pandemic could be extraordinary. We find ourselves in a time of great economic, social, and medical uncertainty. The pandemic demands action on many fronts, from prevention to testing to treatment. We need to create simple, cheap, more accessible testing for SARS-CoV-2. A faster way has to be developed to identify antibodies that neutralize the virus. More than 100 vaccines for the SARS-CoV-2 are at various stages of development. Some six groups have already begun injecting formulations into volunteers in safety trials; others have started testing in animals. The biggest challenge is to determine which vaccine is ideal. Reason and science have to guide us. There is urgent need to critically appraise evidence in deciding how to treat patients. We need a drug or combination of drugs that work. Remdesivir has generated hope. It may prove to be a magic bullet.

Methods: A representative sample of 2,060 Belgians were surveyed in October 2020. Regression analyses identified the predictors associated with willingness to get vaccinated against Covid-19, and attitudes toward vaccination in general. Results: 34% of the participants reported that they will definitely get vaccinated against Covid-19 and 39% that they would probably. Intended uptake was strongly associated with age, opinion on the government's dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic, medical risk, spoken language, gender, and to a lesser extent with having known someone who was hospitalised because of Covid-19. Similar predictors were identified for attitudes to vaccination in general. Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy was more marked in age groups below 54 years old. We further analysed a sample of 17% (N = 349) found favourable to vaccination in general but not willing to be vaccinated against Covid-19. They were mainly female, young, French speaking, slightly less educated, working, and did not belong to a Covid-19 risk group. They were very dissatisfied with the government's dealing with the pandemic, and did not know someone who was hospitalised because of Covid-19. Conclusions: Vaccine hesitancy was higher for Covid-19 vaccines than for other vaccines. The part of the population being convinced of the utility of vaccination in general but hesitant about the Covid-19 vaccine is a primary interest group for tailored communication campaigns in order to reach the vaccine coverage needed for herd immunity.

With this comes the reinforcement of debates between the right to health and pharmaceutical patent rights. The purpose of this study is to illustrate how the Philippines could attempt to balance the right to health with pharmaceutical patent rights in the introduction of a potential COVID-19 vaccine into the country. Design/methodology/approach This will be accomplished through an examination of the flexibilities allowed by international agreements and domestic patent laws. Findings With the economic and health challenges brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Philippine Government will have a strong justification to pursue parallel importation and compulsory licencing under the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights. This is exacerbated by the bold leadership of President Duterte, whose administration has so far shown a propensity to decide in favor of the right to health at the expense of other rights in dealing with the pandemic. Originality/value While this paper focuses on the Philippines, it has a potential application in the least developed and developing countries which aim to gain access to a prospective COVID-19 vaccine. Moreover, while this study discusses the harmonization of laws on the right to health and patent laws as a solution to the COVID-19 pandemic and the lack of access to vaccines, it also calls for solutions that go beyond the application of the law.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2056-4902,,,,,JUL 22,2021,14,3,,,SI,,240,254,,10.1108/IJHRH-09-2020-0075,,MAR 2021,,,,,WOS:000626699400001,,,,,,,,,

Factors related to viral vector VH were partially different from those related to mRNA VH. Students with greater endorsement on conspiracy statements and negative attitudes toward the vaccine had higher odds of being vaccine-hesitant or -resistant. Students who had received a previous COVID-19 test and who scored higher on the agreeableness personality dimension had lower odds to be vaccine-hesitant or -resistant.

We modelled the impact of different prioritisation choices and dose intervals on infections, hospitalisations, mortality, and public health restrictions. An agent-based model was built to quantify the impact of different vaccination strategies over 6 months. Input parameters were derived from published phase 3 trials and official European figures. We explored the effect of prioritising vulnerable people, care-home staff and residents, versus contagious groups; and the impact of dose intervals ranging from 3 to 12 weeks. Prioritising vulnerable people, rather than the most contagious, led to higher numbers of COVID-19 infections, whilst reducing mortality, hospital admissions, and public health restrictions. At a realistic vaccination speed of <= 0 center dot 1% population/day, separating doses by 12 weeks (vs a baseline scenario of 3 weeks) reduced hospitalisations, mortality, and restrictions for vaccines with similar first- and second-dose efficacy (e.g., the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines), but not for those with lower first vs second-dose efficacy (e.g., the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine). Mass vaccination will dramatically reduce the effect of COVID-19 on Europe's health and economy. Early vaccination of vulnerable populations will reduce mortality, hospitalisations, and public health restrictions compared to prioritisation of the most contagious people.

Methods: An international cross-sectional survey was administered to 2557 caregivers of children in 17 pediatric emergency departments (EDs) across 6 countries from March 26, 2020, to June 30, 2020. Caregivers were asked to select 1 of 4 choices with which they most agreed regarding a proposed COVID-19 vaccine-approval process, in addition to questions regarding demographic characteristics, the ED visit, and attitudes about COVID-19. Univariate analyses were conducted using the Mann-Whitney U test for comparing non-normally distributed continuous variables, an independent t test for comparing normally distributed continuous variables, and a chi(2) or Fisher exact test for categorical variables. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used for determining independent factors associated with caregivers' willingness to accept abridged development of a COVID-19 vaccine.

However, the communication of scientific uncertainty is challenging because of its potential to promote ambiguity aversion-a well-described syndrome of negative psychological responses consisting of heightened risk perceptions, emotional distress, and decision avoidance. Communication strategies that can inform the public about scientific uncertainty while mitigating ambiguity aversion are a critical unmet need. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate whether an uncertainty-normalizing communication strategy-aimed at reinforcing the expected nature of scientific uncertainty about the COVID-19 pandemic-can reduce ambiguity aversion, and to compare its effectiveness to conventional public communication strategies aimed at promoting hope and prosocial values. Methods: In an online factorial experiment conducted from May to June 2020, a national sample of 1497 US adults read one of five versions of an informational message describing the nature, transmission, prevention, and treatment of COVID-19; the versions varied in level of expressed scientific uncertainty and supplemental focus (ie, uncertainty-normalizing, hope-promoting, and prosocial). Participants then completed measures of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral manifestations of ambiguity aversion (ie, perceived likelihood of getting COVID-19, COVID-19 worry, and intentions for COVID-19 risk-reducing behaviors and vaccination). Analyses assessed (1) the extent to which communicating uncertainty produced ambiguity-averse psychological responses; (2) the comparative effectiveness of uncertainty-normalizing, hope-promoting, and prosocial communication strategies in reducing ambiguity-averse responses; and (3) potential moderators of the effects of alternative uncertainty communication strategies. Results: The communication of scientific uncertainty about the COVID-19 pandemic increased perceived likelihood of getting COVID-19 and worry about COVID-19, consistent with ambiguity aversion. However, it did not affect intentions for risk-reducing behaviors or vaccination. The uncertainty-normalizing strategy reduced these aversive effects of communicating scientific uncertainty, resulting in levels of both perceived likelihood of getting COVID-19 and worry about COVID-19 that did not differ from the control message that did not communicate uncertainty. In contrast, the hope-promoting and prosocial strategies did not decrease ambiguity-averse responses to scientific uncertainty. Age and political affiliation, respectively, moderated the effects of uncertainty communication strategies on intentions for COVID-19 risk-reducing behaviors and worry about COVID-19. Conclusions: Communicating scientific uncertainty about the COVID-19 pandemic produces ambiguity-averse cognitive and emotional, but not behavioral, responses among the general public, and an uncertainty-normalizing communication strategy reduces these responses. Normalizing uncertainty may be an effective strategy for mitigating ambiguity aversion in crisis communication efforts.

Researchers conducted twenty-five interviews with US Midwestern mothers during the early COVID-19 pandemic months. Mothers were grouped by vaccine hesitancy categories and thematic analysis was used to analyze the data within and across categories. Results showed that prior vaccine hesitancy attitudes and behavior did not fully capture maternal acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine or perception of COVID-19 threat. Perceptions of COVID-19 threat did influence mothers' decisions about COVID-19 protective behaviors (e.g., handwashing, mask wearing, and distancing).

To evaluate the potential of his suggestion, we conducted an experiment investigating the impact of payments and the communication of individual and prosocial benefits of high vaccination rates on vaccination intentions. Our results revealed that none of these interventions or their combinations increased willingness to be vaccinated shortly after a vaccine becomes available.

We designed text-based reminders that make vaccination salient and easy, and delivered them to participants drawn from a healthcare system one day (first randomized controlled trial) (n = 93,354 participants; clinicaltrials number NCT04800965) and eight days (second randomized controlled trial) (n = 67,092 individuals; clinicaltrials number NCT04801524) after they received a notification of vaccine eligibility. The first reminder boosted appointment and vaccination rates within the healthcare system by 6.07 (84%) and 3.57 (26%) percentage points, respectively; the second reminder increased those outcomes by 1.65 and 1.06 percentage points, respectively. The first reminder had a greater effect when it was designed to make participants feel ownership of the vaccine dose. However, we found no evidence that combining the first reminder with a video-based information intervention designed to address vaccine hesitancy heightened its effect. We performed online studies (n = 3,181 participants) to examine vaccination intentions, which revealed patterns that diverged from those of the first randomized controlled trial; this underscores the importance of pilot-testing interventions in the field.

The knowledge base to inform recommendations for optimization of VMA is lacking. We therefore conducted a comprehensive evaluation of EU VMA pathways. Methods: Research in two phases included: (1) mapping VMA pathways in each EU member state (including the UK) based on a literature review, expert interviews, and mathematical archetyping; and (2) interviews with vaccine experts to identify barriers, drivers, and recommendations for regional VMA alignments. Results: Key steps in VMA across the EU include horizon scanning, early advice, National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (NITAG) recommendation for inclusion in national immunization programs, health technology assessment (HTA), final decision and procurement. We found significant complexity and heterogeneity, particularly for early advice, and in the roles, decision-making criteria, and transparency of NITAGs and HTA bodies. The most important drivers for rapid VMA included demonstration of disease burden and vaccine benefit (e.g., efficacy, safety, economic). Key barriers were budget limitations and complexity/clarity of VMA processes (e.g., need for national-regional consensus, clarity on process initiation, and clarity on the role of HTA). Recommendations for alignment at EU and member-state levels include information sharing, joint clinical assessment, initiatives to address funding and political barriers, and improved transparency by decision-making bodies. Early engagement with vaccine stakeholders was a key recommendation for manufacturers. Conclusions: There is significant potential for alignment, collaboration, and improvement of VMA across the EU. Roles, responsibilities, and transparency of key bodies can be clarified. The COVID-19 pandemic response should stimulate policies to improve access to all vaccines, including routine ones, and form the foundation upon which a consistent vaccine ecosystem can be created for the EU, one that is resilient, consistent between member states, and fit for purpose.

Methods: The study used data from an online cross-sectional survey that was conducted in Saudi Arabia between 8 December 2020 and 14 December 2020. This study employed bivariate and multivariable regression analyses. The bivariate was used to describe and tabulate the frequency of all the variables, including the sociodemographic characteristics, the risk perception and the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccination and a chi-squared test of independence was calculated. Multivariable logistic regression models were employed to examine and identify the factors associated with an intention to have the COVID-19 vaccination and the factors associated with its immediate acceptance. Results: Of the total of 736 healthcare workers who began the online questionnaire, 673 completed it (a 91.44% completion rate). Among the study participants, 50.52% were willing to have the COVID-19 vaccine, of which 49.71% intended to have the vaccine as soon as it becomes available in the country, while 50.29% would delay until the vaccine's safety is confirmed. Being a male healthcare worker, perceiving a high risk of infection, and believing that the COVID-19 vaccine should be compulsory for all citizens and residents in the country increased the probability of intention to vaccinate against COVID-19 and the probability of accepting the COVID-19 vaccination as soon as possible.

The development of a vaccine is challenging. We aimed to determine the proportion of people who intend to get vaccinated against COVID-19 in France or to participate in a vaccine clinical trial. Methods: We conducted an anonymous on-line survey from the 26th of March to the 20th of April 2020. Primary endpoints were the intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19 if a vaccine was available or participate in a vaccine clinical trial. Results: Three thousand two hundred and fifty nine individuals answered the survey; women accounted for 67.4% of the respondents. According to their statements, 2.512 participants (77.6%, 95% CI 76.2-79%) will certainly or probably agree to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Older age, male gender, fear about COVID-19, being a healthcare worker and individual perceived risk were associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Vaccine hesitancy was associated with a decrease in COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. One thousand and five hundred and fifty respondents (47.6% 95% CI 45.9-49.3%) will certainly or probably agree to participate in a COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial. Older age, male gender, being a healthcare worker and individual perceived risk were associated with potential acceptance to participate in a COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial. Vaccine hesitancy was associated with refusal for participation in a COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial. Conclusions: Nearly 75% and 48% of the survey respondents were respectively likely to accept vaccination or participation in a clinical trial against COVID-19. Vaccine hesitancy will be the major barrier to COVID-19 vaccine uptake. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Vaccination against this infection can prevent the patients from developing severe disease. But vaccine hesitancy in this group can emerge as a hurdle. So there is a need to understand the perception regarding vaccination in AIRD patients. The study is an interview-based survey done in AIRD patients and a control group from the general population. The questionnaire included the subject's demographic details, duration, diagnosis, the activity of AIRD, and questions regarding the perception of the vaccination. The survey included 280 patients with AIRD and 102 control subjects. 54% (152/280) of the patients and 67% (68/102) of the controls were willing to get vaccinated (p = 0.03). Patients > 45-years of age were more willing to vaccinate than those with age <= 45-years (61.9% vs. 44.8%; p = 0.001). Patients with lower education had more vaccine hesitancy than those with graduation and above (38% vs. 69%; p < 0.001). The common reason for vaccine hesitancy was not-yet-decided, fear related to vaccine side-effects, and disease worsening. 29% (82/280) patients were already vaccinated, out of which 35% (35/82) had mild events (fever/myalgia/headache). AIRD patients had fewer side effects than controls, and disease flare was seen in only one patient. Thus, educating AIRD patients regarding the pros and cons of vaccination, particularly concerning immunological disease, can help us overcome vaccine hesitancy. The message should clearly penetrate that there is a negligible risk of AIRD-flares with the COVID-19 immunization and the side effects are mild and manageable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0172-8172,1437-160X,,,,SEP,2021,41,9,,,,,1601,1605,,10.1007/s00296-021-04938-9,,JUL 2021,,,,,WOS:000669173800001,34213580,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, they can help with evaluating the sufficiency of the vaccination process and its longevity. There are limitations in the current approach of choosing the positive and negative control samples for the validation of those tests. Herein, we are proposing the use of blood samples from positive COVID-19 patients, at the beginning of the disease course, as negative control blood samples for the antibody tests. For more precision, both the negative and the positive control samples can be obtained from the same patients where the accuracy of the test will depend on its ability to detect the sero-conversion, from negative to positive antibodies detection, within the same patient. Furthermore, when the validation of the test is accompanied by detecting/sequencing the viral genome in those COVID-19 patients, this can also aid in determining the accuracy of the test in detecting the immune response to specific viral variants. The latter notion is needed for the proper management of the COVID-19 crisis, new vaccines' manufacturing, and evaluating the vaccines' efficiencies. Finally, this approach could be requested/formulated by the regulatory agencies as part of the tests' validation and can be in-house obtained by health facilities before its clinical use.",,,,,"Al faouri, Ibrahim/0000-0001-6840-8828; El-Salem, Khalid/0000-0002-8163-5256",,,,,,,,,,,,2049-0801,,,,,MAY,2021,65,,,,,,,,102320,10.1016/j.amsu.2021.102320,,,,,,,WOS:000663078000009,33898040,,,,,,,,

Recent measles outbreaks have been attributed to lower-level vaccination coverage among religious minorities, which has inspired targeted as well as wholesale public health interventions and legislation in a range of jurisdictions. The commentary takes the case of self-protective ethnic and religious minority groups, especially Haredi or 'ultra-Orthodox' Jews in the United Kingdom, to address two key aims. First, this commentary flags how damaging representations of religious minorities in recent measles outbreaks can be avoided by better understanding inner processes of vaccine decision-making and acceptance, which can, in turn, help to address hesitancy sustainably and trustfully. Second, the commentary advocates for addressing vaccine hesitancy as part of a broader re-visioning of public health relations with minority groups. This commentary calls on public health services to improve confidence in childhood vaccinations rather than resorting to compulsory (and coercive) vaccination policies in order to address lower-level vaccination coverage.

Methods: Cross-sectional survey. Results: The response rate was 14.5%. Of 1521 HCP with a known profession, 607 (39.9%) were nursing personnel, 480 (31.6%) physicians, 171 (11.2%) paramedical personnel, 72 (4.7%) supportive personnel, and 191 (12.6%) administrative personnel. Overall, 803 of 1571 HCP (51.1%) stated their intention to get vaccinated while 768 (48.9%) stated their intention to decline vaccination. Most HCP (71.3%) who reported intent to get vaccinated noted contributing to the control of the pandemic and protecting their families and themselves as their reasons, while the most common reason for reporting intent to decline vaccination was inadequate information about the vaccines (74.9%), followed by concerns about vaccine safety (36.2%). Logistic regression analysis revealed that the probability of intending to get vaccinated increased with male gender, being a physician, history of complete vaccination against hepatitis B, history of vaccination against pandemic A (H1N1) in 2009-2010, belief that COVID-19 vaccination should be mandatory for HCP, and increased confidence in vaccines in general during the COVID-19 pandemic. The following factors were associated with a lower intention to get vaccinated: no vaccination against influenza the past season, no intention to get vaccinated against influenza in 2020-2021, and no intention to recommend COVID-19 vaccination to high-risk patients. Conclusion: There is an urgent need to built safety perception towards COVID-19 vaccines and raise vaccine uptake rates by HCP, and thus to protect the healthcare workforce and the healthcare services.

Experimental evidence during a global pandemic,BMJ GLOBAL HEALTH,,,,,,,,,,,,"Objective To investigate how health issues affect voting behaviour by considering the COVID-19 pandemic, which offers a unique opportunity to examine this interplay. Design We employ a survey experiment in which treatment groups are exposed to key facts about the pandemic, followed by questions intended to elicit attitudes toward the incumbent party and government responsibility for the pandemic. Setting The survey was conducted amid the lockdown period of 15-26 April 2020 in three large democratic countries with the common governing language of English: India, the United Kingdom and the United States. Due to limitations on travel and recruitment, subjects were recruited through the M-Turk internet platform and the survey was administered entirely online. Respondents numbered 3648. Results Our expectation was that respondents in the treatment groups would favour, or disfavour, the incumbent and assign blame to government for the pandemic compared with the control group. We observe no such results. Several reasons may be adduced for this null finding. One reason could be that public health is not viewed as a political issue. However, people do think health is an important policy area (>85% agree) and that government has some responsibility for health (>90% agree). Another reason could be that people view public health policies through partisan lenses, which means that health is largely endogenous, and yet we find little evidence of polarisation in our data. Alternatively, it could be that the global nature of the pandemic inoculated politicians from blame and yet a majority of people do think the government is to blame for the spread of the pandemic (similar to 50% agree).

Wolfgang Wodarg and Michael Yeadon petitioned to withhold emergency use authorization of the BNT162b2 messenger ribonucleic acid vaccine for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) manufactured by BioNTech and Pfizer, raising concern for female infertility risks but acknowledging the lack of evidence. The European Medicines Agency and the US Food and Drug Administration ultimately issued emergency use authorizations, but misinformation claiming that COVID-19 vaccines cause female infertility began circulating on social media, potentially influencing public perception and medical decision making among pregnant patients or those seeking to become pregnant. Objectives: To determine the potential influence misinformation may have had on public interest in infertility related topics, as analyzed through internet search statistics in the US. Methods: The Google Trends tool was used to analyze results for the search terms infertility, infertility AND vaccine, and infertility AND COVID vaccine in the US from February 4, 2020 to February 3, 2021.

Purpose In the absence of a vaccine, public health messaging to mitigate risks for COVID-19 primarily focuses on social distancing. Because people living with HIV commonly experience mistreatment associated with HIV, their response to social distancing may be complicated by psychosocial attitudes associated with COVID-19. Methods To evaluate these relationships, we conducted a rapid-response, cross-sectional survey with people living with HIV (N = 149) to assess social distancing practices, COVID-19 discriminatory attitudes, COVID-19 xenophobic attitudes, HIV microaggressions, and concern over contracting COVID-19. Data were collected from participants enrolled in a larger ongoing study between March 30, 2020 and April 17, 2020. Results Results indicated that choosing to socially distance to reduce COVID-19 exposure was associated with COVID-19 discriminatory attitudes, concerns of contracting COVID-19, and identifying as transgender. Likewise, social distancing imposed by others (e.g., cancelations and restrictions) was associated with concerns of contracting COVID-19. onclusions Findings demonstrate that social distancing measures are related to concerns of contracting the virus and discriminatory attitudes toward those who are presumed to be living with COVID-19.

The supply of vaccines is insufficient for the global population, so decisions must be made as to which groups are prioritised for any vaccination and when. Furthermore, the aims of vaccination programmes will differ between countries, with some prioritising economic benefits that could stem from the relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions and others seeking simply to reduce the number of COVID-19 cases or deaths. This paper aims to share the experiences and lessons learned from conducting economic evaluations in Singapore and Thailand on hypothetical COVID-19 vaccines to provide a basis for other countries to develop their own contextualised economic evaluations, with particular focus on the key uncertainties, technical challenges, and characteristics that modellers should consider in partnership with key stakeholders. Which vaccines, vaccination strategies, and policy responses are most economically beneficial remains uncertain. It is therefore important for all governments to conduct their own analyses to inform local policy responses to COVID-19, including the implementation of COVID-19 vaccines in both the short and the long run.

Facing one of the world's highest rates of COVID-19 infections and deaths, multiple political actors in Brazil have resorted to judicialization to advance the right to health and other protections in the country. Responding to this litigation has provided the country's Supreme Court an opportunity to assertively confront and counter the executive's necropolitics.

This study aimed to explore the challenges and experiences of providers and users of childhood immunisation services in Nepal during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with childhood immunisation service providers and users (i.e., parents of children) from Kathmandu valley, Nepal. All interviews were conducted through phone or internet-based tools, such as Zoom, WhatsApp, and messenger. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analysed using theme-based content analysis in an Excel spreadsheet. Results A total of 15 participants (n = 7 service providers and n = 8 service users) participated. Six themes were identified, namely: (1) impact of COVID-19 and lockdown on childhood immunisation services; (2) motivation and resilience for childhood immunisation; (3) Biosafety practices and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) availability during the COVID-19 pandemic; (4) service adjustments and guidelines during pandemic; (5) availability of vaccines; and (6) immunisation program resilience in view of COVID-19. Service providers mentioned facing disruptions in services and some parents had decided to delay scheduled immunisation. However, most service providers showed determinations to deliver the services with high morale, while most service users reported taking their children for immunisation. Families migrating from urban to rural areas during the pandemic led to service providers having no means to confirm complete immunisation of migrating children. Service providers also experienced lack of adequate guidance to deal with the pandemic and personal protective equipment to protect themselves and service users. Conclusion Despite experiencing disruptions in childhood immunisation service due to the COVID-19 pandemic, service users and providers were determined to vaccinate the children.

At the same time, laboratories and institutions are working hard to obtain a COVID-19 vaccine, which we hope will be available soon. However, there has been no assessment of whether an individual and society value a vaccine monetarily, and what factors determine this value. Therefore, the objective of this research was to estimate the individual's willingness to pay (WTP) for a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine and, at the same time, find the main factors that determine this valuation. For this, we used the contingent valuation approach, in its single and double-bounded dichotomous choice format, which was based on a hypothetical market for a vaccine. The sample used was obtained through an online survey of n = 566 individuals from Chile. The main results showed that the WTP depends on the preexistence of chronic disease (p <= 0.05), knowledge of COVID-19 (p <= 0.05), being sick with COVID-19 (p <= 0.05), perception of government performance (p <= 0.01), employment status (p <= 0.01), income (p <= 0.01), health care (p <= 0.05), adaptation to quarantine with children at home (p < 0.01) and whether the person has recovered from COVID-19 (p < 0.10). According to our discrete choice model in double-bounded dichotomous format, it was concluded that the individuals' WTP is US$184.72 (CI: 165.52-203.92; p < 0.01).

While the search for a vaccine represents the hope to overcome the pandemic, measures were established to control the disease transmission through individual and collective actions of hygiene and physical distancing. Based on the popular clamor for new vaccines, this critical essay discusses the paradox and contradictions of the individual-society relationship in the context of COVID-19 considering vaccine hesitancy as a historical and social phenomenon. We also argue that decisions on (not) vaccinating or (not) following COVID-19 control and preventive measures are influenced by social belonging and traversed by inequalities that tend to exacerbate. COVID-19 surrounding infodemic and vaccine hesitancy reflect the tension between scientifically-validated and self-perceived risk, besides being impacted by the crisis of confidence in science.

Findings In this decision analytical model assessing multiple scenarios for the infectious period and the proportion of transmission from individuals who never have COVID-19 symptoms, transmission from asymptomatic individuals was estimated to account for more than half of all transmission. Meaning The findings of this study suggest that the identification and isolation of persons with symptomatic COVID-19 alone will not control the ongoing spread of SARS-CoV-2. Importance Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is readily transmitted person to person. Optimal control of COVID-19 depends on directing resources and health messaging to mitigation efforts that are most likely to prevent transmission, but the relative importance of such measures has been disputed. Objective To assess the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 transmissions in the community that likely occur from persons without symptoms. Design, Setting, and Participants This decision analytical model assessed the relative amount of transmission from presymptomatic, never symptomatic, and symptomatic individuals across a range of scenarios in which the proportion of transmission from people who never develop symptoms (ie, remain asymptomatic) and the infectious period were varied according to published best estimates. For all estimates, data from a meta-analysis was used to set the incubation period at a median of 5 days. The infectious period duration was maintained at 10 days, and peak infectiousness was varied between 3 and 7 days (-2 and +2 days relative to the median incubation period). The overall proportion of SARS-CoV-2 was varied between 0% and 70% to assess a wide range of possible proportions. Main Outcomes and Measures Level of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from presymptomatic, never symptomatic, and symptomatic individuals. Results The baseline assumptions for the model were that peak infectiousness occurred at the median of symptom onset and that 30% of individuals with infection never develop symptoms and are 75% as infectious as those who do develop symptoms. Combined, these baseline assumptions imply that persons with infection who never develop symptoms may account for approximately 24% of all transmission. In this base case, 59% of all transmission came from asymptomatic transmission, comprising 35% from presymptomatic individuals and 24% from individuals who never develop symptoms. Under a broad range of values for each of these assumptions, at least 50% of new SARS-CoV-2 infections was estimated to have originated from exposure to individuals with infection but without symptoms. Conclusions and Relevance In this decision analytical model of multiple scenarios of proportions of asymptomatic individuals with COVID-19 and infectious periods, transmission from asymptomatic individuals was estimated to account for more than half of all transmissions. In addition to identification and isolation of persons with symptomatic COVID-19, effective control of spread will require reducing the risk of transmission from people with infection who do not have symptoms. These findings suggest that measures such as wearing masks, hand hygiene, social distancing, and strategic testing of people who are not ill will be foundational to slowing the spread of COVID-19 until safe and effective vaccines are available and widely used. This decision analytical model assesses the proportion of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmissions in the community that likely occur from persons without symptoms.",,,,,"Quandelacy, Talia/0000-0002-4059-577X",,,,,,,,,,,,2574-3805,,,,,JAN 7,2021,4,1,,,,,,,e2035057,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.35057,,,,,,,WOS:000610370500006,33410879,,,,,,,,

Global acceptance to an effective vaccine is the most anticipated resolution. This study aims to evaluate intent to be vaccinated among public in Saudi Arabia during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional web-based study was designed in Saudi Arabia. Study participants (N = 658) were recruited through snowball sampling. The SurveyMonkey platform was used to record the response. Cross-tabulation was performed by participants' intention to vaccinate against COVID-19 virus with sociodemographic characteristics and respondents' risk perception toward COVID-19, trust in the healthcare system, and their history of vaccine hesitancy behavior. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to compute the predictors of vaccination intention among the study participants. Results: Six hundred fifty-eight participants completed the survey (females = 47.4%). Of the 658 participants, 351 (53.3%) have shown intent to be vaccinated. Five hundred nineteen (78.8%) of the participants were reported to be at high risk of COVID-19, and 307 (46.6%) were reported to trust the healthcare system in the country. The multivariable analysis shows respondents with a high-risk perception (OR: 2.27, 95% CI: 1.49-3.48); higher trust in the healthcare system (OR: 3.24, 95% CI: 2.32-4.61) was found to be the significant factor affecting the decision in acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine in Saudi Arabia.

There is no specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19, and many vaccine candidates are currently under clinical trials. This study aimed to understand the perception of social media users regarding a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine in Nigeria. Methods: we conducted a cross-sectional survey among social media users in Nigeria in August 2020 using an online questionnaire. The questionnaire includes sections on the demographic characteristics of the respondents and their perception regarding a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine. A total of 517 respondents completed and returned the informed consent along with the questionnaire electronically. Data were coded and abstracted into Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and loaded into the STATA 14 software for final analysis. Results: the results showed that more than half of the respondents were male 294 (56.9%). Most of the respondents 385 (74.5%) intend to take the COVID-19 vaccine when it becomes available. Among the 132 respondents that would not take the COVID-19 vaccine, the major reason for non-acceptance was unreliability of the clinical trials 49 (37.1%), followed by the belief that their immune system is sufficient to combat the virus 36 (27.3%). We found a significant association between the age of the respondents and the COVID-19 vaccine acceptance (P-value=0.00) as well as geographical location and COVID-19 vaccine acceptance (P-value=0.02). Conclusion: it was observed that most of the respondents were willing to take the COVID-19 vaccine. Our findings also reiterate the need to reassure the public the benefits an effective and safe COVID-19 vaccine can reap for public health.

Social media listening (infoveillance) can not only monitor public attitudes on COVID-19 vaccines but also assess the dissemination of and public engagement with these opinions. Objective: This study aims to assess global hesitancy, confidence, and public engagement toward COVID-19 vaccination. Methods: We collected posts mentioning the COVID-19 vaccine between June and July 2020 on Twitter from New York (United States), London (United Kingdom), Mumbai (India), and Sao Paulo (Brazil), and Sina Weibo posts from Beijing (China). In total, we manually coded 12,886 posts from the five global metropolises with high COVID-19 burdens, and after assessment, 7032 posts were included in the analysis. We manually double-coded these posts using a coding framework developed according to the World Health Organization's Confidence, Complacency, and Convenience model of vaccine hesitancy, and conducted engagement analysis to investigate public communication about COVID-19 vaccines on social media. Results: Among social media users, 36.4% (571/1568) in New York, 51.3% (738/1440) in London, 67.3% (144/214) in Sao Paulo, 69.8% (726/1040) in Mumbai, and 76.8% (2128/2770) in Beijing indicated that they intended to accept a COVID-19 vaccination. With a high perceived risk of getting COVID-19, more tweeters in New York and London expressed a lack of confidence in vaccine safety, distrust in governments and experts, and widespread misinformation or rumors. Tweeters from Mumbai, Sao Paulo, and Beijing worried more about vaccine production and supply, whereas tweeters from New York and London had more concerns about vaccine distribution and inequity. Negative tweets expressing lack of vaccine confidence and misinformation or rumors had more followers and attracted more public engagement online. Conclusions: COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is prevalent worldwide, and negative tweets attract higher engagement on social media.

We examined the intention to receive vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 and the associated factors in a representative sample of Chinese adults in Hong Kong. Methods: We did a dual-frame (landline and mobile) cross-sectional survey of a random sample of 1501 Hong Kong residents aged 18 years or older (53.6% females) in April 2020. We collected data on the intention to receive SARS-CoV-2 vaccine when it becomes available (yes/no/undecided), knowledge and perceptions of COVID-19, smoking, alcohol drinking, and sociodemographic factors. Prevalence estimates were weighted by the sex, age, and education of the general population of Hong Kong. Results: Overall, 45.3% (95% CI: 42.3-48.4%) of the participants had intentions to vaccinate against SARSCoV-2 when it becomes available, 29.2% (26.5-32.1%) were undecided, and 25.5% (22.9-28.2%) had no intention. The most common reason for vaccine hesitancy (undecided or no intention) was safety concerns (56.5%). Multivariable partial proportional odds model showed higher vaccine hesitancy in males, younger adults, those with no chronic disease, current smokers, and non-alcohol drinkers. After adjusting for sociodemographic and other factors, inadequate knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 transmission (adjusted ORs ranged from 1.27 to 2.63; P < 0.05) and lower perceived danger of COVID-19 (adjusted ORs ranged from 1.62 to 2.47; P < 0.001) were significantly associated with vaccine hesitancy. Conclusions: In a representative sample of Chinese adults in Hong Kong, only 45.3% of the participants intended to vaccinate against SARS-CoV-2 when available. Vaccine hesitancy was associated with inadequate knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 transmission and lower perceived danger of COVID-19, which needed to be addressed to improve vaccination uptake.

In this article we review the standard FDA approach to vaccine evaluation, which underpins its current approaches to assessment of vaccines to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The FDA has established pathways to accelerate vaccine availability before approval, such as Emergency Use Authorization, and to channel resources to high-priority products and allow more flexibility in the evidence required for approval, including accelerated approval based on surrogate markers of effectiveness. Among the thirty-five new vaccines approved in the US from 2006 through October 2020, about two-thirds of their pivotal trials used the surrogate outcome of immune system response, and only one-third evaluated actual disease incidence. Postapproval safety surveillance of new vaccines, and particularly vaccines receiving expedited approval, is crucial. This has generally been accomplished through such mechanisms as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and FDA Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, the CDC Vaccine Safety Datalink, and the CDC Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment Project.

Thus, there is a dire need for early and accurate detection of COVID-19 to prevent the spread of the disease, even more. The current gold-standard RT-PCR test is only 71% sensitive and is a laborious test to perform, leading to the incapability of conducting the population-wide screening. To this end, in this paper, we propose an automated COVID-19 detection system that uses CT-scan images of the lungs for classifying the same into COVID and Non-COVID cases. The proposed method applies an ensemble strategy that generates fuzzy ranks of the base classification models using the Gompertz function and fuses the decision scores of the base models adaptively to make the final predictions on the test cases. Three transfer learning-based convolutional neural network models are used, namely VGG-11, Wide ResNet-50-2, and Inception v3, to generate the decision scores to be fused by the proposed ensemble model.

By leveraging cohort-level clinical data, patient-level hospital data, and census-level epidemiological data, we develop an integrated four-step approach, combining descriptive, predictive and prescriptive analytics. First, we aggregate hundreds of clinical studies into the most comprehensive database on COVID-19 to paint a new macroscopic picture of the disease. Second, we build personalized calculators to predict the risk of infection and mortality as a function of demographics, symptoms, comorbidities, and lab values. Third, we develop a novel epidemiological model to project the pandemic's spread and inform social distancing policies.

The guidelines also identify subpopulations of Americans deemed to be at high risk for severe disease should they contract COVID19. These guidelines were based on population level demographics, rather than individual-level risk factors. As such, they may misidentify individuals at high risk for severe illness, and may therefore be of limited use in decisions surrounding resource allocation to vulnerable populations. The objective of this study was to evaluate a machine learning algorithm for prediction of serious illness due to COVID-19 using inpatient data collected from electronic health records. Methods: The algorithm was trained to identify patients for whom a diagnosis of COVID-19 was likely to result in hospitalization, and compared against four U.S. policy-based criteria: age over 65; having a serious underlying health condition; age over 65 or having a serious underlying health condition; and age over 65 and having a serious underlying health condition. Results: This algorithm identified 80% of patients at risk for hospitalization due to COVID-19, versus 62% identified by government guidelines.

Social media is increasingly used as a source of vaccination data and as a powerful communication tool to increase vaccination. In December 2020, we performed a cross-sectional social media-based survey addressing personal sentiments toward COVID-19 vaccination in the USA. Our primary research objective is to identify socio-demographic characteristics and the reasons for the 1644 survey participants' attitudes regarding vaccination. We present clear evidence that, contrary to the prevailing public perceptions, young audiences using social media have mostly a positive attitude towards COVID-19 vaccination (81.5%).

Recent findings COVID-19 has created unique and unexpected challenges to healthcare delivery, but has also provided opportunities for re-evaluation of practice patterns to optimize high-value practices. With ongoing uncertainty, key factors to appreciate for patient and population health include the continued touchstones of empathy and compassion, the use of effective risk communication with shared clinical decision-making when appropriate, attention to resource stewardship and vulnerable populations, importance of health literacy and need for critical assessment of media and medical literature to mitigate misinformation, and the hidden costs of the pandemic on children. Although there has been some international concern for allergic reactions to the recently approved Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, neither the United States Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine emergency use authorizations exclude patients without a specific allergy to a vaccine component from receiving vaccination. Practical adjustments to practice during COVID-19 are feasible and acceptable.

Method: A cross-national survey was conducted in both China and the United States, and discrete choice experiments, as well as Likert scales, were utilized to assess vaccine preference and the underlying factors contributing to vaccination acceptance. Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to enable a direct comparison between the two countries. Results: A total of 9077 (5375 and 3702 from China and the United States, respectively) respondents completed the survey. After propensity score matching, over 82.0% of respondents from China positively accepted the COVID-19 vaccination, while 72.2% of respondents from the United States positively accepted it. Specifically, only 31.9% of Chinese respondents were recommended by a doctor to have COVID-19 vaccination, while more than half of the U.S. respondents were recommended by a doctor (50.2%), local health board (59.4%), or friends and families (64.8%). The discrete choice experiments revealed that respondents from the United States attached the greatest importance to the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines (44.41%), followed by the cost of vaccination (29.57%), whereas those from China held a different viewpoint, that the cost of vaccination covered the largest proportion in their trade-off (30.66%), and efficacy ranked as the second most important attribute (26.34%). Additionally, respondents from China tended to be much more concerned about the adverse effect of vaccination (19.68% vs. 6.12%) and have a lower perceived severity of being infected with COVID-19. Conclusion: Although the overall acceptance and hesitancy of COVID-19 vaccination in both countries are high, underpinned distinctions between these countries were observed.

J,"Schlickeiser, R; Kroger, M",,,,"Schlickeiser, Reinhard; Kroeger, Martin",,,Analytical Modeling of the Temporal Evolution of Epidemics Outbreaks Accounting for Vaccinations,PHYSICS,,,,,,,,,,,,"With the vaccination against Covid-19 now available, how vaccination campaigns influence the mathematical modeling of epidemics is quantitatively explored. In this paper, the standard susceptible-infectious-recovered/removed (SIR) epidemic model is extended to a fourth compartment, V, of vaccinated persons. This extension involves the time t-dependent effective vaccination rate, v(t), that regulates the relationship between susceptible and vaccinated persons. The rate v(t) competes with the usual infection, a(t), and recovery, mu(t), rates in determining the time evolution of epidemics. The occurrence of a pandemic outburst with rising rates of new infections requires k+b<1-2 eta, where k=mu(0)/a(0) and b=v(0)/a(0) denote the initial values for the ratios of the three rates, respectively, and eta MUCH LESS-THAN1 is the initial fraction of infected persons. Exact analytical inverse solutions t(Q) for all relevant quantities Q=[S,I,R,V] of the resulting SIRV model in terms of Lambert functions are derived for the semi-time case with time-independent ratios k and b between the recovery and vaccination rates to the infection rate, respectively. These inverse solutions can be approximated with high accuracy, yielding the explicit time-dependences Q(t) by inverting the Lambert functions. The values of the three parameters k, b and eta completely determine the reduced time evolution of the SIRV-quantities Q(tau). The influence of vaccinations on the total cumulative number and the maximum rate of new infections in different countries is calculated by comparing with monitored real time Covid-19 data. The reduction in the final cumulative fraction of infected persons and in the maximum daily rate of new infections is quantitatively determined by using the actual pandemic parameters in different countries. Moreover, a new criterion is developed that decides on the occurrence of future Covid-19 waves in these countries. Apart from in Israel, this can happen in all countries considered.",,,,"Kroger, Martin/C-1946-2008","Kroger, Martin/0000-0003-1402-6714; Schlickeiser, Reinhard/0000-0003-3171-5079",,,,,,,,,,,,,2624-8174,,,,JUN,2021,3,2,,,,,386,426,,10.3390/physics3020028,,,,,,,WOS:000668551900001,,,,,,,,,

Here, we tried to investigate the attitude and acceptance rates for COVID-19 vaccine in cancer patients and identify predictive factors for vaccination that could be modified to promote vaccine uptake rates. Between February and April 2021, a total of 1001 cancer patients from five institutions participated in a paper-based survey, consisting of 58 items over six domains. Among the respondents, 61.8% were willing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Along with the previously reported predictors for COVID-19 vaccination, including male gender, older age, and influenza vaccination history, we distinctively found that patient's disease status and health status (absence of cancer recurrence, time since cancer diagnosis over 5 years, and higher EuroQol Visual Analogue Scale scores) were associated with higher acceptance rates of vaccination. Furthermore, physician's recommendations effectively reduced patient's vaccine hesitancy. Considering the high morbidity and mortality of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients with malignancy, they are regarded as a priority for COVID-19 vaccination. However, general vaccine uptake rates among cancer patients are known to be lower than in their healthy counterparts. Thus, we aimed to investigate the attitude and acceptance rates for the COVID-19 vaccine in cancer patients and identify predictive factors for vaccination that could be modified to increase vaccine uptake rates, via a paper-based survey (58 items over six domains). A total of 1001 cancer patients participated in this nationwide, multicenter survey between February and April 2021. We observed that 61.8% of respondents were willing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Positive predictive factors found to be independently associated with vaccination were male gender, older age, obesity, previous influenza vaccination history, absence of cancer recurrence, time since cancer diagnosis over 5 years, and higher EuroQol Visual Analogue Scale scores. Along with the well-known factors that are positively correlated with vaccination, here, we report that patients' disease status and current health status were also associated with their acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccination. Moreover, 91.2% of cancer patients were willing to be vaccinated if their attending physicians recommend it, indicating that almost 30% could change their decision upon physicians' recommendation. Unlike other factors, which are unmodifiable, physicians' recommendation is the single modifiable factor that could change patients' behavior. In conclusion, we firstly report that Korean cancer patients' acceptance rate of the COVID-19 vaccination was 61.8% and associated with disease status and current health status.

Nigeria and much of the rest of the world blindly adopted treatments like chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine and various prevention strategies, often without monitoring the efficacy of these treatment and social control strategies. COVID-19 provided Nigeria a critical opportunity to create or strengthen its national laboratory system by building up its Level 3 laboratories in all parts of the country with the capability to perform PCR tests and viral isolation. There was also an opportunity to establish hospitals in every region of a sufficient standard to reduce the numbers of Nigerians travelling abroad to seek medical treatment; to invest in building capacity to develop antiviral medications and vaccines in Nigeria, and to ensure better international health policies. Rather, Nigerian leaders, government and health managers decided (like most other nations of the world) to shut down the society using isolationist policies that were not necessarily tailored to local needs. Despite adopting these methods, COVID-19 cases continued to skyrocket in Nigeria. In the future, before adopting such broad sweeping policies, there should be local tailoring to assess their effectiveness in different communities.

We obtain a fundamental relationship between event R and four parameters: transmission intensity, duration of exposure, the proximity of individuals, and the degree of mixing. We use reports of small outbreaks to establish event R and transmission intensity in a range of settings.

These genetic factors, some of which are associated with blood type, may account for variations in observed responses to COVID-19. Hence, assessments of these genetic differences and blood type could provide possible benefits in gauging patients' risks of disease acquisition and prioritising allocation of interventions or vaccines, if supplies are limited. The media has widely reported these findings, and people online are now discussing their blood type and its possible effects on their COVID-19 risks, but several ethical concerns arise. Individuals possessing genetic variants or blood types associated with lower risk may engage in 'risk compensation', erroneously assuming that they can protect themselves less, and hence less frequently wearing masks or washing hands. Given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, many physicians, hospitals, patients, policymakers, members of the public, testing companies and others may well consider these factors in making critical prevention/treatment decisions. Researchers, providers and others should thus begin to address these concerns. Increased awareness and education aimed at providers, patients, family members, public health officials, political leaders and the public-at-large are critical.

Understanding public acceptance of such a novel vaccine is vital, but little is known about the topic. Objectives This study aimed to investigate the determinants of intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine and willingness to pay (WTP) among people in Bangladesh. Methods An anonymous and online-based survey of Bangladeshi people (mean age = 29.96 +/- 9.15 years; age range = 18-60 years) was conducted using a self-reported questionnaire consisting of socio-demographics, COVID-19 experience, and vaccination-related information as well as the health belief model (HBM). Multivariable logistic regression was performed to determine the factors influencing COVID-19 vaccination intent and WTP. Results Of the 894 participants, 38.5% reported a definite intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, whereas 27% had a probable intention, and among this intent group, 42.8% wanted to get vaccinated as soon as possible. Older age, feeling optimistic about the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination, believing that vaccination decreases worries and risk of COVID-19 infection, and being less concerned about side effects and safety of COVID-19 vaccination under the HBM construct were found to be significant factors in COVID-19 vaccination intention. Most of the participants (72.9%) were willing to pay for a COVID-19 vaccine, with a median (interquartile range [IQR]) amount of BDT 400/US$ 4.72 (IQR; BDT 200-600/US$ 2.36-7.07) per dose. Factors associated with higher WTP were younger age, being male, having higher education, residing in an urban area, having good self-rated health status, positivity towards COVID-19 vaccination's effectiveness, and being worried about the likelihood of getting infected with COVID-19. Participants who were COVID-19 vaccination intent preferred an imported vaccine over a domestically-made vaccine (22.9% vs. 14.8%), while 28.2% preferred a routine immunization schedule. Conclusion The findings indicate a considerable proportion of Bangladeshi people intended to get vaccinated and had WTP for the COVID-19 vaccine. However, urgent education and awareness programs are warranted to alleviate public skepticism regarding the COVID-19 vaccination.",,,,"Hossain, Sahadat/AAB-9052-2019","Hossain, Sahadat/0000-0001-9433-202X; Islam, Md.

Methods: A case-control study was conducted on the Saudi Arabian population during September 2020. The data were collected from recovered COVID-19 participants as the case group, and healthy volunteers as the control group. Results: The data showed that 42.2% (n = 315) of recovered COVID-19 cases were more willing to participate in the COVID-19 vaccine trial than healthy volunteers (299; 38.1%) with a p < 0.001. The proportion of the participants who were willing to donate plasma was significantly higher among recovered participants, 84.2% (n = 112), than healthy volunteers, 76.3% (n = 87), with ap < 0.0001. The most significant factor responsible for a willingness to participate was the belief that vaccine discovery would help scientific developments (r = 0.525 and 0.465 for case and control, respectively). In comparison, significant reasons behind the unwillingness to participate were the risk of exposure to an unproven vaccine, r = 0.377 and 0.497 for case and control, respectively (p < 0.001), and a discomfort with being treated as an experimental subject (r = 0.275 and 0.374 for case and control, respectively). Conclusions: The differences in readiness toward the COVID-19 vaccine trial in our study does not indicate any passive exposure of participants to an unproven clinical trial vaccine, nor does it shed light on well-informed risk-related decisions.

Particularities of SARS-CoV-2, such as its persistence in surfaces and the lack of a curative treatment or vaccine against COVID-19, have pushed authorities to apply restrictive policies to control its spreading. As data drove most of the decisions made in this global contingency, their quality is a critical variable for decision-making actors, and therefore should be carefully curated. In this work, we analyze the sources of error in typically reported epidemiological variables and usual tests used for diagnosis, and their impact on our understanding of COVID-19 spreading dynamics. We address the existence of different delays in the report of new cases, induced by the incubation time of the virus and testing-diagnosis time gaps, and other error sources related to the sensitivity/specificity of the tests used to diagnose COVID-19. Using a statistically-based algorithm, we perform a temporal reclassification of cases to avoid delay-induced errors, building up new epidemiologic curves centered in the day where the contagion effectively occurred. We also statistically enhance the robustness behind the discharge/recovery clinical criteria in the absence of a direct test, which is typically the case of non-first world countries, where the limited testing capabilities are fully dedicated to the evaluation of new cases. Finally, we applied our methodology to assess the evolution of the pandemic in Chile through the Effective Reproduction Number R-t, identifying different moments in which data was misleading governmental actions. In doing so, we aim to raise public awareness of the need for proper data reporting and processing protocols for epidemiological modelling and predictions. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that the strategies utilized by healthcare providers to improve influenza vaccination rates can similarly be applied to the administration of a COVID-19 vaccine. The purpose of this study was to determine the rationale of low influenza vaccination rates in an urban allergy clinic and how to improve patient education and knowledge regarding the importance of influenza vaccination. A three-year comparison of interventions is presented as well as its application to future COVID-19 vaccinations. Methods: This study was performed at an outpatient allergy and clinical immunology practice (MSBI) with hospital affiliation in New York City, New York. A quality improvement medical committee was formed to optimize influenza vaccination rates to greater than 71% and established standardized protocols regarding patient intake workflows, vaccine counseling, and documentation. Patient records from four providers were used for this study to compare pre-and post-intervention rates. Results: 984 patients met inclusion criteria, with a normal distribution of ages (18-80), race, and sex. Average vaccination rates prior to the intervention were 9.25-13.60%. The average vaccination rate after the intervention was 91.34%. Discussion: The MSBI quality improvement study identified key areas to address in improving influenza vaccination rates. Vaccine hesitancy, public misinformation, and ambivalence surrounding vaccination with egg allergies or during a subcutaneous immunotherapy injection were all topics addressed during the 2018-2019 intervention year. Additional attention was also put toward provider education and standardization of documentation. Shared decision making and intensive education/outreach efforts are needed by physicians and patients alike to overcome vaccine hesitancy. In comparing this to upcoming COVID-19 vaccine challenges, similar barriers will likely also need to be addressed. Greater research is needed to understand patient motivations regarding hesitancy specific to the COVID-19 vaccine. Conclusion: As evidenced in the yearly battle with influenza and now the COVID-19 pandemic, it has become essential to identify and implement multi-level strategies to maximize vaccination rates, especially amid a global pandemic. With COVID-19 vaccines reaching emergency approval stages, it is important for healthcare providers to start creating workflows and strategies to address patient inquiries. The influenza vaccination quality improvement project presented here can be used as a guideline for future evaluations of COVID-19 vaccination efforts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2168-8184,,,,JAN 7,2021,13,1,,,,,,,e12549,10.7759/cureus.12549,,,,,,,WOS:000606245900008,33437559,,,,,,,,

Alternatively, surrogate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) using ACE2 as the target structure for the detection of neutralization-competent antibodies have been developed. They are capable of high throughput, have a short turnaround time, and can be performed under standard laboratory safety conditions. However, there are very limited data on their clinical performance and how they compare to the PRNT. We evaluated three surrogate immunoassays (GenScript SARS-CoV-2 Surrogate Virus Neutralization Test Kit (GenScript Biotech, Piscataway Township, NJ, USA), the TECO(R) SARS-CoV-2 Neutralization Antibody Assay (TECOmedical AG, Sissach, Switzerland), and the Leinco COVID-19 ImmunoRank (TM) Neutralization MICRO-ELISA (Leinco Technologies, Fenton, MO, USA)) and one automated quantitative SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein-based IgG antibody assay (Abbott GmbH, Wiesbaden, Germany) by testing 78 clinical samples, including several follow-up samples of six BNT162b2 (BioNTech/Pfizer, Mainz, Germany/New York, NY, USA) vaccinated individuals. Using the PRNT as a reference method, the overall sensitivity of the examined assays ranged from 93.8 to 100% and specificity ranged from 73.9 to 91.3%.

The contingent valuation (CV) method was used as the basis for the analyses. Data for this study were obtained from a survey of 1,050 individuals in Kenya conducted from April 7 to April 15, 2020. The survey included CV questions using a double-bounded dichotomous choice format. Results reveal that most of the individuals in Kenya (at least 96%) were willing to accept a COVID-19 vaccine. Approximately 80% of individuals were willing to pay a positive amount. Conservative estimates of individuals' mean WTP for the vaccine range from USD 49.81 to USD 68.25 (depending on vaccine characteristics). Both vaccine duration of protection and efficacy were found to influence WTP (p < .10). The perceived probability of being hospitalized, age, gender, education, location and region of residence, and household income were also found to be associated with WTP for the vaccine (p < .10).

Therefore, the development of effective strategies is urgent to control the COVID-19 outbreak. According to recent investigations, cell entry of coronaviruses relies on binding of the viral spike glycoprotein to the host cellular receptors. Therefore, the present study aimed to predict immunogenic epitopes in silico by analysing the spike protein. In parallel, by screening the immunogenic SARS-CoV-2 spike-derived epitopes provided in the literature, we chose a set of epitopes that we believed would induce immunogenic response. Next, provided with the epitopes selected by using both approaches, we performed immunoinformatic analysis that mapped identically to the antigen regions and antigenic properties. Finally, after selecting a screened set of epitopes, we designed a novel virus-like particle vaccine optimized to be produced in plants by using molecular farming biotechnology techniques. Our assay may be used as a starting point for guiding experimental efforts towards the development of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.

We aimed to explore their beliefs about the coronavirus and COVID-19 vaccine willingness and to assess the impact of the pandemic on perinatal experiences and practices. A multinational, cross-sectional, web-based study was performed in six European countries between April and July 2020. The anonymous survey was promoted via social media. In total, 16,063 women participated (including 6661 pregnant and 9402 breastfeeding women). Most responses were collected from Belgium (44%), Norway (18%) and the Netherlands (16%), followed by Switzerland (11%), Ireland (10%) and the UK (3%). Despite differences between countries, COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was identified among 40-50% of the respondents at the end of the first wave of the pandemic and was higher among pregnant women. Education level and employment status were associated with vaccine hesitancy. The first wave had an adverse impact on pregnancy experiences and disrupted access to health services and breastfeeding support for many women. In the future, access to health care and support should be maintained at all times. Evidence-based and tailored information on COVID-19 vaccines should also be provided to pregnant and breastfeeding women to avoid unfounded concerns about the vaccines and to support shared decision making in this population.",,,,"Ceulemans, Michael/G-5368-2019; allegaert, karel/C-3611-2016","Ceulemans, Michael/0000-0002-4130-5869; allegaert, karel/0000-0001-9921-5105; Nordeng, Hedvig/0000-0001-6361-2918; Pomar, Leo/0000-0002-3021-8129; Passier, Anneke/0000-0001-5594-6360; Winterfeld, Ursula/0000-0002-9926-7164; Foulon, Veerle/0000-0002-4053-3915",,,,,,,,,,,,,1660-4601,,,,APR,2021,18,7,,,,,,,3367,10.3390/ijerph18073367,,,,,,,WOS:000638485400001,33805097,,,,,,,,

Although most (74.8%) participants valued influenza vaccination positively and declared that it should be mandatory, some misconceptions around influenza persist. The general practitioner was the main source of trusted information on influenza vaccines, while social networks were judged to be the least reliable. Younger and less affluent individuals, subjects not vaccinated in the previous season, and those living in smaller communities showed lower odds of receiving the 2020/21 season influenza vaccination. However, the COVID-19 pandemic may have positively influenced the propensity of being vaccinated against 2020/21 seasonal influenza.

Till now there are no vaccines and explicit medicines available for the treatment of COVID-19 disease, therefore the initiatives like public health and social measures are helpful in limiting the quantity of contaminations and saving lives. Keeping this in view, an attempt has been made in the present work to identify the barriers which hinder the implementation of these public health and social measures Methods: The barriers to implement public health and social measures for preventing transmission of COVID-19 are identified using systematic literature review and these barriers are then categorized using Decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method. Results: Results reveal that among ten identified barriers, Lack of resources for implementing public health and social measures is found to be the most influential barrier to implement public health and social measures for preventing transmission of COVID-19. Conclusions: The successful implementation of public health and social measures depends on the adequate availability of resources which include medical equipment, personnel and financial dealings. The outcome of this research work will benefit and motivate the higher authorities to consider and overcome various challenges to prevent the transmission of COVID-19. (c) 2020 Diabetes India.

The method, that is widely used for the detection of COVID-19 is Reverse Transcription Polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which is a time-consuming method and is prone to manual errors, and has poor precision. Although many nations across the globe have begun the mass immunization procedure, the COVID-19 vaccine will take a long time to reach everyone. The application of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) has been used in the domain of medical imaging for a long period. It is quite evident that the use of CAD in the detection of COVID-19 is inevitable. The main objective of this paper is to use convolutional neural network (CNN) and a novel feature selection technique to analyze Chest X-Ray (CXR) images for the detection of COVID-19. We propose a novel two-tier feature selection method, which increases the accuracy of the overall classification model used for screening COVID-19 CXRs. Filter feature selection models are often more effective than wrapper methods as wrapper methods tend to be computationally more expensive and are not useful for large datasets dealing with a large number of features. However, most filter methods do not take into consideration how a group of features would work together, rather they just look at the features individually and decide on a score. We have used approximate Shapley value, a concept of Coalition game theory, to deal with this problem. Further, in the case of a large dataset, it is important to work with shorter embeddings of the features. We have used CUR decomposition and Nystrom sampling to further reduce the feature space. To check the efficacy of this two-tier feature selection method, we have applied it to the features extracted by three standard deep learning models, namely VGG16, Xception and InceptionV3, where the features have been extracted from the CXR images of COVID-19 datasets and we have found that the selection procedure works quite well for the features extracted by Xception and InceptionV3.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1868-5137,1868-5145,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s12652-021-03491-4,,SEP 2021,,,,,WOS:000697609600001,34567278,,,,,,,,

Almost all of these vaccines have been designed to induce antibodies targeting the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in expectation of neutralizing activities. However, nonneutralizing antibodies are at risk of causing antibody-dependent enhancement. Further, the longevity of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies is very short. Therefore, in addition to antibody-inducing vaccines, novel vaccines developed on the basis of SARS-CoV-2-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) should be considered. Here, we attempted to identify HLA-A*02:01-restricted CTL epitopes derived from the nonstructural polyprotein 1a of SARS-CoV-2. Eighty-two peptides were first predicted as epitope candidates based on bioinformatics. Fifty-four of the 82 peptides showed high or medium binding affinities to HLA-A*02:01. HLA-A*02:01 transgenic mice were then immunized with each of the 54 peptides encapsulated into liposomes. The intracellular cytokine staining assay revealed that 18 out of 54 peptides were active as CTL epitopes because of the induction of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma)-producing CD8 T cells. Of the 18 peptides, 10 peptides were chosen for the following analyses because of their high responses. To identify dominant CTL epitopes, mice were immunized with liposomes containing the mixture of the 10 peptides. Some peptides were shown to be statistically predominant over the other peptides. Surprisingly, all mice immunized with the liposomal 10-peptide mixture did not show the same reaction pattern to the 10 peptides. There were three response patterns, suggesting the existence of an immunodominance hierarchy following peptide vaccination, which may provide more variations in the epitope selection for designing CTL-based COVID-19 vaccines.

Hence there is an urgent need to investigate the factors leading to an individuals' willingness to choose to self-isolate. OBJECTIVES: The current study utilized the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) as a conceptual model and aimed to investigate the extent to which subjective norms, personal attitudes and perceived control influences an individual's willingness to self-isolate during COVID-19 risk. METHOD: A cross-sectional study was performed on 800 Saudi respondents aged >= 18 years by using a validated self-administered questionnaire about factors related to willingness to self-isolate during COVID-19 pandemic risk based on the TPB. The effects of different variables on SI were analyzed by using ordinal logistic regression model. RESULTS: A total of 756 (94.5%) were completed and analyzed. Subjective norms and perceived control over the behavior significantly (p < 0.05) influenced the intention of willingness to self-isolate, while attitude was found to be insignificant. The odds of letting others to know about self COVID status were 2.40 times higher than not telling the neighbors or colleagues. A statistically significant difference (p <= 0.001) existed between males and females regarding the willingness to self-isolate. Similarly the odds of willingness to self-isolate with a presence of disabled person in family were 2.88 times higher than the absence of a disability in the family. Few recommendations for the policymakers that are needed to curb the spread of COVID-19 infection are also proposed. CONCLUSION: The outcomes of study might be considered as an initial understanding of the factors that significantly influences an individual's willingness to SI when facing an unprecedented pandemic risk. Additionally, these factors provide a plan for policymakers to encourage citizens for self-isolation during pandemic infections.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1051-9815,1875-9270,,,,,2021,70,1,,,,,11,20,,10.3233/WOR-205322,,,,,,,WOS:000703419400003,34487003,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to evaluate the demand for a COVID-19 vaccine in Ecuador by estimating individuals' willingness to pay (WTP) for the vaccine, and by assessing the effect of vaccine attributes (duration of protection and efficacy) and individuals' characteristics on this valuation. The sample used (N = 1,050) was obtained through an online survey conducted from April 2 to April 7, 2020. Two levels of vaccine efficacy (70% and 98%) and two levels of vaccine duration of protection (1 and 20 years) were considered. The willingness to pay estimates were obtained using a double-bounded dichotomous-choice contingent valuation format. Survey results show that a very large proportion of individuals (at least 97%) were willing to accept a COVID-19 vaccine, and at least 85% of individuals were willing to pay a positive amount for that vaccine. Conservative estimates of the average WTP values ranged from USD 147.61 to 196.65 and the median WTP from USD 76.9 to 102.5. Only the duration of protection was found to influence individuals' WTP for the vaccine (p < 0.01). On average, respondents were willing to pay 30% more for a COVID-19 vaccine with 20 years of protection relative to the vaccine with 1 year of protection. Regression results show that WTP for the vaccine was associated with income, employment status, the perceived probability of needing hospitalization if contracting the virus causing COVID-19, and region of residence.

The purpose of this study is to facilitate universities in planning disease mitigation interventions as they respond to the pandemic. Design/methodology/approach An agent-based model is developed to mimic the virus transmission dynamics on campus. Scenario-based experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of various interventions including course modality shift (from face-to-face to online), social distancing, mask use and vaccination. A case study is performed for a typical US university. Findings With 10%, 30%, 50%, 70% and 90% course modality shift, the number of total cases can be reduced to 3.9%, 20.9%, 35.6%, 60.9% and 96.8%, respectively, comparing against the baseline scenario (no interventions). More than 99.9% of the total infections can be prevented when combined social distancing and mask use are implemented even without course modality shift. If vaccination is implemented without other interventions, the reductions are 57.1%, 90.6% and 99.6% with 80%, 85% and 90% vaccine efficacies, respectively. In contrast, more than 99% reductions are found with all three vaccine efficacies if mask use is combined.

These policies had significant economic impacts and caused social disruptions. Early re-opening is preferable, but it introduces the risk of a resurgence of the epidemic. Although the World Health Organization has outlined criteria for re-opening, decisions on re-opening are mainly based on epidemiologic criteria. To date, the effectiveness of re-opening policies remains unclear. Methods: A system dynamics COVID-19 model, SEIHR(Q), was constructed by integrating infection prevention and control measures implemented in Wuhan into the classic SEIR epidemiological model and was validated with real-world data. The input data were obtained from official websites and the published literature. Results: The simulation results showed that track-and-trace measures had significant effects on the level of risk associated with re-opening. In the case of Wuhan, where comprehensive contact tracing was implemented, there would have been almost no risk associated with re-opening. With partial contact tracing, re-opening would have led to a minor second wave of the epidemic. However, if only limited contact tracing had been implemented, a more severe second outbreak of the epidemic would have occurred, overwhelming the available medical resources. If the ability to implement a track-trace-quarantine policy is fixed, the epidemiological criteria need to be further taken into account. The model simulation revealed different levels of risk associated with re-opening under different levels of track-and-trace ability and various epidemiological criteria. A matrix was developed to evaluate the effectiveness of the re-opening policies. Conclusions: The SEIHR(Q) model designed in this study can quantify the impact of various re-opening policies on the spread of COVID-19. Integrating epidemiologic criteria, the contact tracing policy, and medical resources, the model simulation predicts whether the re-opening policy is likely to lead to a further outbreak of the epidemic and provides evidence-based support for decisions regarding safe re-opening during an ongoing epidemic.",,,,,"Zhao, Jidi Judy/0000-0001-7855-1070",,,,,,,,,,,,,1471-2458,,,,SEP 7,2021,21,1,,,,,,,1638,10.1186/s12889-021-11631-w,,,,,,,WOS:000693661000004,34493226,,,,,,,,

Moreover, we intend to evaluate neonatal clinical outcomes. Hence, our age range of interest is 0 to 19 years. Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted using the Medline database to identify papers published between 1 December 2019 and 9 April 2020 on COVID-19. Results: The search identified 27 relevant scientific papers and letters. The review showed that the prevalence of COVID-19 in the paediatric population accounts for a small percentage of patients, whose clinical signs and symptoms are often milder than those of adults. Despite better prognosis and low mortality in children, the disease can progress to severe pneumonia in some cases, especially in the presence of co-morbidities. Children are likely to become a hidden source of infection because of their atypical presentation, and they may play a role in community transmission, leading to unfavourable outcomes. There is little evidence about intrauterine vertical transmission. As no vaccine or specific antiviral is currently available, management plans include supportive treatment. Conclusion: As compared with that in adults, the presentation of COVID-19 in children is mild and has a better prognosis. Sufficient evidence regarding the probability of intrauterine vertical transmission could not be found, and further studies need to be conducted to establish this relationship.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1024-2708,,,,,FEB,2021,27,1,,,,,35,45,,10.12809/hkmj208646,,,,,,,WOS:000617776500007,32994372,,,,,,,,

This requires an ethical analysis that includes conflicts in the field of vaccine research and development, global justice in vaccine distribution, prioritization decisions when the supply of vaccines does not meet demand and the positions that should be taken by public institutions to address vaccine hesitancy among people who either do not want to take the vaccine or raise doubts about it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0211-402X,2014-881X,,,,,2020,,65,,,,,57,73,,10.5565/rev/enrahonar.1307,,,,,,,WOS:000587491100006,,,,,,,,,

WHY DOES THIS MATTER? There is widespread interest in whether drug interventions can be used for the prevention of covid-19, but there is uncertainty about which drugs, if any, are effective. The first version of this living guideline focuses on the evidence for hydroxychloroquine. Subsequent updates will cover other drugs being investigated for their role in the prevention of covid-19. RECOMMENDATION The guideline development panel made a strong recommendation against the use of hydroxychloroquine for individuals who do not have covid-19 (high certainty). HOW THIS GUIDELINE WAS CREATED This living guideline is from the World Health Organization (WHO) and provides up to date covid-19 guidance to inform policy and practice worldwide. Magic Evidence Ecosystem Foundation (MAGIC) provided methodological support. A living systematic review with network analysis informed the recommendations. An international guideline development panel of content experts, clinicians, patients, an ethicist and methodologists produced recommendations following standards for trustworthy guideline development using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. UNDERSTANDING THE NEW RECOMMENDATION The linked systematic review and network meta-analysis (6 trials and 6059 participants) found that hydroxychloroquine had a small or no effect on mortality and admission to hospital (high certainty evidence). There was a small or no effect on laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (moderate certainty evidence) but probably increased adverse events leading to discontinuation (moderate certainty evidence). The panel judged that almost all people would not consider this drug worthwhile. In addition, the panel decided that contextual factors such as resources, feasibility, acceptability, and equity for countries and healthcare systems were unlikely to alter the recommendation. The panel considers that this drug is no longer a research priority and that resources should rather be oriented to evaluate other more promising drugs to prevent covid-19. UPDATES This is a living guideline. New recommendations will be published in this article and signposted by update notices to this guideline. READERS NOTE This is the first version of the living guideline for drugs to prevent covid-19. It complements the WHO living guideline on drugs to treat covid-19. When citing this article, please consider adding the update number and date of access for clarity. Drugs could be used as prophylaxis to prevent covid-19 developing in those who are free from disease. Such drugs complement vaccines that, through developing immune responses to SARS-Cov-2, reduce the risk of developing covid-19 and its consequences. Drugs to prevent covid-19 could target whole populations, those at higher risk of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 (due to their work, social circumstances, or a particular exposure), or those at higher risk of death and poor outcomes if infected. There are 2610 trials investigating various drug interventions for covid-19 (see section on emerging evidence).1 This rapidly evolving evidence landscape requires trustworthy interpretation and expeditious clinical practice guidelines to inform clinicians, patients, governments, ministries and health administrators. This living guideline uses emerging evidence from RCTs on drugs to prevent covid-19 and complements the livingWHOguideline on drugs to treat covid-19.(2) The living network meta-analysis associated with this guideline will incorporate new trial data and allow for analysis of comparative effectiveness.3 Details of the network meta-analysis and other related publications are listed in box 1. We will also use additional relevant evidence on long term safety, prognosis, and patient values and preferences related to covid-19 treatments to inform the living guidance.",,,,"Burhan, Erlina/AAR-6425-2021; Souza, Joao Paulo/G-1982-2010; Venkatapuram, Sridhar/B-4846-2017","Burhan, Erlina/0000-0002-6617-499X; Souza, Joao Paulo/0000-0002-2288-4244; Qasim, Anila/0000-0001-9658-0078; Stegemann, Miriam Songa/0000-0002-7968-0429; Kum, Elena/0000-0002-6548-2632; Venkatapuram, Sridhar/0000-0003-3076-0783",,,,,,,,,,,,1756-1833,,,,,MAR 2,2021,372,,,,,,,,n526,10.1136/bmj.n526,,,,,,,WOS:000625340300003,33649077,,,,,,,,

Despite non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distance, mask-wearing, and restrictive lockdown, the daily confirmed cases remain growing. Vaccine developments from Pfizer, Moderna, and Gamaleya Institute reach more than 90% efficacy and sustain the vaccination campaigns in multiple countries. However, natural and vaccine-induced immunity responses remain poorly understood. There are great expectations, but the new SARS-CoV-2 variants demand to inquire if the vaccines will be highly protective or induce permanent immunity. Further, in the first quarter of 2021, vaccine supply is scarce. Consequently, some countries that are applying the Pfizer vaccine will delay its second required dose. Likewise, logistic supply, economic and political implications impose a set of grand challenges to develop vaccination policies. Therefore, health decision-makers require tools to evaluate hypothetical scenarios and evaluate admissible responses. Following some of the WHO-SAGE recommendations, we formulate an optimal control problem with mixed constraints to describe vaccination schedules. Our solution identifies vaccination policies that minimize the burden of COVID-19 quantified by the number of disability-adjusted years of life lost. These optimal policies ensure the vaccination coverage of a prescribed population fraction in a given time horizon and preserve hospitalization occupancy below a risk level. We explore via simulationplausible scenarios regarding efficacy, coverage, vaccine-induced, and natural immunity. Our simulations suggest that response regarding vaccine-induced immunity and reinfection periods would play a dominant role in mitigating COVID-19.",,,,"Carrasco, David Baca/AAR-4373-2021; Acuna-Zegarra, Manuel Adrian/AAU-2200-2020","Carrasco, David Baca/0000-0001-7006-3953; Acuna-Zegarra, Manuel Adrian/0000-0002-5895-2456",,,,,,,,,,,,0025-5564,1879-3134,,,,JUL,2021,337,,,,,,,,108614,10.1016/j.mbs.2021.108614,,,,,,,WOS:000657621800003,33961878,,,,,,,,

In Saudi Arabia, the Ministry of Health called for citizens and residents to take up the vaccine as an essential step to return life to normal. However, the take-up calls were made in the face of profound disagreements on social media platforms and online networks about the value and efficacy of the vaccines. Thus, this study seeks to explore the responses of Saudi citizens to the COVID-19 vaccines and their sentiments about being vaccinated using opinion mining methods to analyze data extracted from Twitter, the most widely used social media network in Saudi Arabia. A corpus of 37,467 tweets was built. Vector space classification (VSC) methods were used to group and categorize the selected tweets based on their linguistic content, classifying the attitudes and responses of the users into three defined categories: positive, negative, and neutral. The lexical semantic properties of the posts show a prevalence of negative responses. This indicates that health departments need to ensure citizens are equipped with accurate, evidence-based information and key facts about the COVID-19 vaccines to help them make appropriate decisions when it comes to being vaccinated. Although the study is limited to the analysis of attitudes of people to the COVID-19 vaccines in Saudi Arabia, it has clear implications for the application of opinion mining using computational linguistic methods in Arabic.",,,,"Omar, Abdulfattah/AAI-4943-2020","Omar, Abdulfattah/0000-0002-3618-1750",,,,,,,,,,,,2158-107X,2156-5570,,,,JUN,2021,12,6,,,,,72,78,,,,,,,,,WOS:000686178900010,,,,,,,,,

However, although vaccinations provide good protection, they do not offer full immunity and while they likely reduce transmission of the virus to others, the extent of this remains uncertain. This produces a dilemma for communicators who wish to be transparent about benefits and harms and encourage continued caution in vaccinated individuals but not undermine confidence in an important public health measure. In two large pre-registered experimental studies on quota-sampled UK public participants we investigate the effects of providing transparent communication-including uncertainty-about vaccination effectiveness on decision-making. In Study 1 (n = 2097) we report that detailed information about COVID-19 vaccines, including results of clinical trials, does not have a significant impact on beliefs about the efficacy of such vaccines, concerns over side effects, or intentions to receive a vaccine. Study 2 (n = 2217) addressed concerns that highlighting the need to maintain protective behaviours (e.g., social distancing) post-vaccination may lower perceptions of vaccine efficacy and willingness to receive a vaccine. We do not find evidence of this: transparent messages did not significantly reduce perceptions of vaccine efficacy, and in some cases increased perceptions of efficacy. We again report no main effect of messages on intentions to receive a vaccine. The results of both studies suggest that transparently informing people of the limitations of vaccinations does not reduce intentions to be vaccinated but neither does it increase intentions to engage in protective behaviours post-vaccination.",,,,"Kerr, John/AAX-1806-2020","Kerr, John/0000-0002-6606-5507; Freeman, Alexandra/0000-0002-4115-161X",,,,,,,,,,,,,2076-393X,,,,APR,2021,9,4,,,,,,,379,10.3390/vaccines9040379,,,,,,,WOS:000643770900001,33924542,,,,,,,,

In the case of a novel disease with widespread consequences, society is more likely to place significant value on interventions that reduce the outsized economic burden of COVID-19. Treatments for severe disease will have a different value profile to that of large-scale vaccines because of their application in targeted and potentially small subsets of those with symptomatic disease vs broad deployment as a preventative measure. Where vaccines reduce transmissibility of COVID-19, use of therapeutics will target symptoms, up to and including death for infected individuals. This paper describes discussions from a virtual expert panel that met to attempt a consensus on how existing principles of economic evaluation should be applied to therapeutics that emerge in a pandemic setting, with specific focus on severe hospitalised cases of COVID-19. The panel concluded that the core principles of economic evaluation do not need to be drastically overhauled to meet the challenges of a pandemic, but that there are several additional elements of value such as equity, disease severity, insurance value, and scientific and family spillover effects that should be considered when presenting results to decision makers. The panel also highlighted the persistent challenges on how society should value novel therapies, such as the appropriate cost-effectiveness threshold to apply, which are particularly salient during a pandemic.",,,,"Geisler, Benjamin P./A-9244-2010","Geisler, Benjamin P./0000-0003-1704-6067; Asukai, Yumi/0000-0003-1837-5604",,,,,,,,,,,,1170-7690,1179-2027,,,,NOV,2021,39,11,,,,,1201,1208,,10.1007/s40273-021-01088-5,,SEP 2021,,,,,WOS:000698527900001,34557996,,,,,,,,

Methods: An extended susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) compartmental model was used to simulate COVID-19 spread when considering diagnosis, isolation, and vaccination of a cohort of 1 million individuals. The scenarios modeled represented 4 pandemic severity scenarios and various times when the vaccine becomes available during the pandemic. Eligible individuals have a probability p of receiving antibody testing prior to vaccination (p = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1). The vaccine was modeled as a single dose vaccine with 90% and 70% efficacy. The value of serology testing was evaluated by comparing the infection attack rate, peak infections, peak day, and deaths. Results: The use of antibody testing to prioritize the allocation of limited vaccines reduces infection attack rates and deaths. The size of the reduction depends on when the vaccine becomes available relative to the infection peak day. The largest percentage reduction in cases and deaths occurs when the vaccine is deployed before and close to the infection peak day. The reduction in the number of cases and deaths diminishes as vaccine deployment is delayed. Conclusions: Antibody testing as part of the vaccination plan is an effective method to maximize the benefit of a COVID-19 vaccine. Decision-makers need to consider relative timing between the infection peak day and when the vaccine becomes available. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: During February 2021 Shalvata Mental Health hospital provided Covid-19 vaccines to its patients. Fifty one patients suffering from severe mental illness, out of 196 patients hospitalized in closed, open or day wards during that period, signed the informed consent and were assessed for their clinical condition (OQ-45), fear of Covid-19 (FCV-19S) and approach to the vaccine (C19-VHS). All patients who were not vaccinated in February 2021 (baseline) were re-approached a month later to assess whether they had gotten vaccinated since. Results: Patients who were not vaccinated at baseline had an oppositional approach to the vaccine, and did not significantly differ in their fear of Covid-19 levels or in levels of clinical severity (t(49) = 2.51, p = 0.02) from those who were vaccinated. From the 29 patients who were not vaccinated at baseline approach to the vaccine was a good predictor to getting vaccinated after one month (79% positive predictive value). Conclusions: The majority of patients suffering from a severe mental illness are willing to get vaccinated, and their decision of whether or not to get vaccinated is based on their viewpoint on the vaccine rather than being an outcome of their level of distress (OQ-45). It is important to allow vaccine accessibility to hospitalized patients, to consider their opinions and to provide useful information to lower vaccine hesitancy and improve vaccination rates.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-3956,1879-1379,,,,NOV,2021,143,,,,,,16,20,,10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.08.020,,,,,,,WOS:000705315000003,34438198,,,,,,,,

Initial observations show that especially among younger vaccinated people side effects are common. In this study, using the example of clinic employees, the self-perceived well-being after the first and second dose of the vaccine was examined. Methods Anonymized online questionnaire to be filled out once by all employees after the second dose of BNT162B2 was offered. The severity of side effects was queried using an ordinal numerical rating scale with values between 0 and 10. Other key data points were age, gender, and occupational group. The ability to work in the days following the injections was recorded by self-reporting. Results Data from 555 respondents were evaluated. The mean age was 40.25 years (standard deviation 12.35). 56 % of the respondents were female, 44.3 % belonged to the medical service, 42.9 % to the nursing service and 12.8 % were assigned to other professional groups with COVID-19 patient contact. Around 2 % of all employees did not experience any side effects at all. The most common side effect was pain at the injection site. Fatigue, headaches and myalgia followed with decreasing frequency. After the first dose, 3/4 of the respondents said they had tolerated the vaccination well overall, after the second dose it was only half. After the first dose, over 90 % of the respondents felt that they were able to work again on the following day, after the second dose one third stated that they were only able to work again on the second day. 2.2 % of all employees had to report that they were unable to work for at least one day after the first dose and 19.5 % after the second dose. Conclusions Vaccination with BNT162B2 frequently leads to side effects, especially after the second dose. Perception of side effects resulted in 19 % of those questioned being sick after the second dose. Nevertheless, 95 % of all respondents would choose a coronavirus vaccination again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0012-0472,1439-4413,,,,AUG,2021,146,16,,,,,E58,E64,,10.1055/a-1520-2127,,,,,,,WOS:000686744700001,34243217,,,,,,,,

In this study we aimed to evaluate the anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect of siRNA both in vitro and in vivo. Methods To identify the most effective molecule out of a panel of 15 in silico designed siRNAs, an in vitro screening system based on vectors expressing SARS-CoV-2 genes fused with the firefly luciferase reporter gene and SARS-CoV-2-infected cells was used. The most potent siRNA, siR-7, was modified by Locked nucleic acids (LNAs) to obtain siR-7-EM with increased stability and was formulated with the peptide dendrimer KK-46 for enhancing cellular uptake to allow topical application by inhalation of the final formulation - siR-7-EM/KK-46. Using the Syrian Hamster model for SARS-CoV-2 infection the antiviral capacity of siR-7-EM/KK-46 complex was evaluated. Results We identified the siRNA, siR-7, targeting SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) as the most efficient siRNA inhibiting viral replication in vitro. Moreover, we showed that LNA-modification and complexation with the designed peptide dendrimer enhanced the antiviral capacity of siR-7 in vitro. We demonstrated significant reduction of virus titer and lung inflammation in animals exposed to inhalation of siR-7-EM/KK-46 in vivo.

Patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD) have unstable immune function and receive immunosuppressive therapy frequently, so they are hardly to make a decision to receive vaccination. Our study investigated the vaccine hesitancy and coping styles in patients with NMOSD to analyze the relationship between vaccine hesitancy and coping styles, and elucidate the factors influencing vaccine hesitancy. Methods: A convenient sampling method was used to recruit participants. The Adult Vaccine Hesitancy Scale and Medical Coping Modes Questionnaire were used to measure the vaccine hesitancy and coping style of the participants. Pearson correlation, multiple stepwise, linear regression, and one-way analysis of variance were used to analyze the data. Results: A total of 262 NMOSD patients were investigated. The score of vaccine hesitancy in NMOSD patients is lower (21.13 +/- 4.355) than 25 points which indicated the patient is not considered to have vaccine hesitancy. The score for vaccine hesitancy was negatively correlated with the confrontation and avoidance coping styles (r = -0.481 and r = 0.423). That adoption of the coping styles of confrontation and avoidance as well as the residence of the patient were predictors of vaccine hesitation in NMOSD patients (R-2(adj) = 0.29, P < 0.001). In addition, the vaccine hesitancy scores of NMOSD patients residing in rural areas were significantly higher than those of patients living in urban areas (P < 0.01). Comparing with each level of education, the scores were not statistically significant in vaccine hesitancy and coping styles (P > 0.05). Conclusions: This study reveals that the NMOSD patients is not considered to have vaccine hesitancy, Patients who tend to adopt confrontation and avoidance coping styles have less vaccine hesitancy. Health authorities and medical specialist teams should strengthen effective vaccination information for patients with NMOSD, such as expert consensus or guidelines through various media to help them with decision-making.

The use of compartment models can be a worthwhile and attractive approach to address this problem. The present study proposes a model compartmentalized by sex and age groups that allows for more complete information on the evolution of the CoViD-19 pandemic in Italy. Material and methods: Italian public data on CoViD-19 were pre-treated with a 7-day moving average filter to reduce noise. A time-varying susceptible-infected-recovered-deceased (SIRD) model distributed by age and sex groups was then proposed. Recovered and infected individuals distributed by groups were reconstructed through the SIRD model, which was also used to simulate and identify optimal scenarios of pandemic containment by vaccination. The simulation started from realistic initial conditions based on the SIRD model parameters, estimated from filtered and reconstructed Italian data, at different pandemic times and phases. The following three objective functions, accounting for total infections, total deaths, and total quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) lost, were minimized by optimizing the percentages of vaccinated individuals in five different age groups. Results: The developed SIRD model clearly highlighted those pandemic phases in which younger people, who had more contacts and lower mortality, infected older people, characterized by a significantly higher mortality, especially in males. Optimizing vaccination strategies yielded different results depending on the cost function used. As expected, to reduce total deaths, the suggested strategy was to vaccinate the older age groups, whatever the baseline scenario. In contrast, for QALYs lost and total infections, the optimal vaccine solutions strongly depended on the initial pandemic conditions: during phases of high virus diffusion, the model suggested to vaccinate mainly younger groups with a higher contact rate. Conclusion: Because of the poor quality and insufficient availability of stratified public pandemic data, ad hoc information filtering and reconstruction procedures proved essential. The time-varying SIRD model, stratified by age and sex groups, provided insights and additional information on the dynamics of CoViD-19 infection in Italy, also supporting decision making for containment strategies such as vaccination.",,,,"Cartocci, Alessandra/AAB-5831-2020","Cartocci, Alessandra/0000-0002-1818-6275",,,,,,,,,,,,1532-0464,1532-0480,,,,JUN,2021,118,,,,,,,,103793,10.1016/j.jbi.2021.103793,,,,,,,WOS:000663600500003,33901696,,,,,,,,
J,"Ilyin, SO",,,,"Ilyin, Sergey O.",,,A Recursive Model of the Spread of COVID-19: Modelling Study,JMIR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SURVEILLANCE,,,,,,,,,,,,"Background: The major medical and social challenge of the 21st century is COVID-19, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Critical issues include the rate at which the coronavirus spreads and the effect of quarantine measures and population vaccination on this rate. Knowledge of the laws of the spread of COVID-19 will enable assessment of the effectiveness and reasonableness of the quarantine measures used, as well as determination of the necessary level of vaccination needed to overcome this crisis. Objective: This study aims to establish the laws of the spread of COVID-19 and to use them to develop a mathematical model to predict changes in the number of active cases over time, possible human losses, and the rate of recovery of patients, to make informed decisions about the number of necessary beds in hospitals, the introduction and type of quarantine measures, and the required threshold of vaccination of the population. Methods: This study analyzed the onset of COVID-19 spread in countries such as China, Italy, Spain, the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, France, and Germany based on publicly available statistical data. The change in the number of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recovered persons over time was examined, considering the possible introduction of quarantine measures and isolation of infected people in these countries. Based on the data, the virus transmissibility and the average duration of the disease at different stages were evaluated, and a model based on the principle of recursion was developed. Its key features are the separation of active (nonisolated) infected persons into a distinct category and the prediction of their number based on the average duration of the disease in the inactive phase and the concentration of these persons in the population in the preceding days. Results: Specific values for SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility and COVID-19 duration were estimated for different countries. In China, the viral transmissibility was 3.12 before quarantine measures were implemented and 0.36 after these measures were lifted. For the other countries, the viral transmissibility was 2.28-2.76 initially, and it then decreased to 0.87-1.29 as a result of quarantine measures. Therefore, it can be expected that the spread of SARS-CoV-2 will be suppressed if 56%-64% of the total population becomes vaccinated or survives COVID-19. Conclusions: The quarantine measures adopted in most countries are too weak compared to those previously used in China. Therefore, it is not expected that the spread of COVID-19 will stop and the disease will cease to exist naturally or owing to quarantine measures. Active vaccination of the population is needed to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Furthermore, the required specific percentage of vaccinated individuals depends on the magnitude of viral transmissibility, which can be evaluated using the proposed model and statistical data for the country of interest.",,,,"Ilyin, Sergey O./B-2946-2011","Ilyin, Sergey O./0000-0002-7947-8845",,,,,,,,,,,,2369-2960,,,,,APR,2021,7,4,,,,,,,e21468,10.2196/21468,,,,,,,WOS:000647221500002,33871381,,,,,,,,

A total of 2569 anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG determination on dried blood spot samples were carried out, firstly in a cohort of 1181 individuals at random time-points, and subsequently, in an independent cohort of 88 vaccinated subjects, up to the seventeenth week from the first dose administration. Spike-specific T-cells were analysed in seronegative subjects between the two doses. AZD1222 induced lower anti-S1 IgG levels as compared to BNT162b2. Moreover, 40% of AZD1222 vaccinated subjects and 3% of BNT162b2 individuals resulted in seronegative during all the time-points, between the two doses.

Vaccine development was immediately propelled to the centre of all our scientific, public health and community efforts. Despite the development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines arguably being the greatest and most palpable achievements of the past 12 months, they have also been one of the most contentious and debated issues during the pandemic. However, what uniquely differentiates vaccine development is its intimate relationship with the community it seeks to serve; both in its clinical trial testing as an efficacious and safe prophylactic, and its post-developmental 'roll-out' success, as an effective public health tool. These relationships have birthed a myriad of complexities, from community-based mistrust, to academically contended ethical dilemmas. Indeed, the accelerated advances in the COVID-19 vaccine race have further exacerbated this phenomenon, bringing with it new ethical dilemmas that need to be examined to ensure the continued clinical success of these therapeutics and a renewed societal trust in clinical medicine. In this paper, we discuss two major ethical dilemmas: (1) the equipoise of continuing new vaccine trials in the advent of successful candidates and (2) the maleficence of blinded placebo arms. Accordingly, we discuss six different potential approaches to these ethical dilemmas: (1) continuing with placebo-controlled trials, (2) transitioning from placebo-controlled to open-label, (3) unblinding at-risk priority groups only, (4) transitioning to a blinded stepped-wedge cross-over design, (5) progressing to a blinded active-controlled stepped-wedge cross-over trial, and (6) conducting randomised stepped-wedge community trials. We also propose a decision-making algorithm for relevant stakeholders in advanced stages of vaccine trials. It is important to remember that the emergent nature of the COVID-19 situation does not justify a compromise on core ethical values. In fact, the discourse surrounding this topic and the decisions made will remain a potent case study and a continuously referenced example for all such future scenarios.",,,,,"Al-Qahtani, Manaf/0000-0002-1523-0429; Mallah, Saad/0000-0002-2234-1530",,,,,,,,,,,,,1745-6215,,,,SEP 15,2021,22,1,,,,,,,628,10.1186/s13063-021-05597-8,,,,,,,WOS:000696216400007,34526086,,,,,,,,

We discuss the role of platform vaccines and prototype pathogen research in modern vaccine development, and outline how previous pathogen-specific funding approaches can be improved to adequately promote vaccine R&D for emerging pandemics. We present a more comprehensive approach to financing vaccine R&D, which maximises biomedical pandemic preparedness by promoting flexible vaccine platforms and translatable research into prototype pathogens. As the numerous platform-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines show, funders can accelerate pandemic vaccine development by proactively investing in versatile platform technologies. For certain emerging infectious diseases, where vaccine research can translate to other related pathogens with pandemic potential, investment decisions should reflect the full social value of increasing overall preparedness, rather than just the value of bringing a vaccine to market for individual pathogens.",,,,,"Monrad, Joshua Teperowski/0000-0002-7377-2074; Sandbrink, Jonas/0000-0002-8244-956X",,,,,,,,,,,,,2059-0105,,,,FEB 11,2021,6,1,,,,,,,26,10.1038/s41541-021-00290-y,,,,,,,WOS:000617204000001,33574335,,,,,,,,

The decision whether or not to get vaccinated has so far been left to the individual citizens. However, there are good reasons, both in theory as well as in practice, to believe that the willingness to get vaccinated might not be sufficiently high to achieve herd immunity. A policy of mandatory vaccination could ensure high levels of vaccination coverage, but its legitimacy is doubtful. We investigate the willingness to get vaccinated and the reasons for an acceptance (or rejection) of a policy of mandatory vaccination against COVID-19 in June and July 2020 in Germany based on a representative real time survey, a random sub-sample (SOEP-CoV) of the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP). Our results show that about 70 percent of adults in Germany would voluntarily get vaccinated against the coronavirus if a vaccine without side effects was available. About half of residents of Germany are in favor, and half against, a policy of mandatory vaccination. The approval rate for mandatory vaccination is significantly higher among those who would get vaccinated voluntarily (around 60 percent) than among those who would not get vaccinated voluntarily (27 percent). The individual willingness to get vaccinated and acceptance of a policy of mandatory vaccination correlates systematically with socio-demographic and psychological characteristics of the respondents. We conclude that as far as people's declared intentions are concerned, herd immunity could be reached without a policy of mandatory vaccination, but that such a policy might be found acceptable too, were it to become necessary.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,MAY 10,2021,16,5,,,,,,,e0248372,10.1371/journal.pone.0248372,,,,,,,WOS:000664624400007,33970933,,,,,,,,

Providing the results of economic evaluation for mass vaccination is of paramount importance for all stakeholders worldwide. Methods: We developed a Markov decision tree for the economic evaluation of mass vaccination against COVID-19. The effectiveness of reducing outcomes after the administration of three COVID-19 vaccines (BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech), mRNA-1273 (Moderna), and AZD1222 (Oxford-AstraZeneca)) were modelled with empirical parameters obtained from literatures. The direct cost of vaccine and COVID-19 related medical cost, the indirect cost of productivity loss due to vaccine jabs and hospitalization, and the productivity loss were accumulated given different vaccination scenarios. We reported the incremental cost-utility ratio and benefit/cost (B/C) ratio of three vaccines compared to no vaccination with a probabilistic approach. Results: Moderna and Pfizer vaccines won the greatest effectiveness among the three vaccines under consideration. After taking both direct and indirect costs into account, all of the three vaccines dominated no vaccination strategy. The results of B/C ratio show that one dollar invested in vaccine would have USD $13, USD $23, and USD $28 in return for Moderna, Pfizer, and AstraZeneca, respectively when health and education loss are considered. The corresponding figures taking value of the statistical life into account were USD $176, USD $300, and USD $443. Conclusion: Mass vaccination against COVID-19 with three current available vaccines is cost-saving for gaining more lives and less cost incurred. Copyright (C) 2021, Formosan Medical Association.

Methods U.S. adults aged 65 and older enrolled in the Heartline(TM) clinical study were invited to complete a COVID-19 vaccine assessment through the Heartline(TM) mobile application between November 6-20, 2020. Factors associated with willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine were evaluated using an ordered logistic regression as well as a Random Forest classification algorithm. Results Among 9,106 study participants, 81.3% (n = 7402) responded and had available demographic data. The majority (91.3%) reported a willingness to be vaccinated. Factors most strongly associated with vaccine willingness were beliefs about the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines and vaccines in general. Women and Black or African American respondents reported lower willingness to vaccinate. Among those less willing to get vaccinated, 66.2% said that they would talk with their health provider before making a decision. During the study, positive results from the first COVID-19 vaccine outcome study were released; vaccine willingness increased after this report. Conclusions Even among older adults at high-risk for COVID-19 complications who are participating in a longitudinal clinical study, 1 in 11 reported lack of willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccine in November 2020. Variability in vaccine willingness by gender, race, education, and income suggests the potential for uneven vaccine uptake. Education by health providers directed toward assuaging concerns about vaccine safety and efficacy can help improve vaccine acceptance among those less willing.

The aim of the study was to assess knowledge, awareness and attitude of Italian Pediatric Health Care Professionals (pHCPs) on vaccinations. Methods An anonymous on-line questionnaire was developed within the Vaccine Committee of Italian Society of Pediatric Allergy and Immunology (SIAIP) and spontaneously completed by 231 Pediatricians and Pediatric Nurses (PN). Results An accurate vaccine education was reported by 70% of pediatricians and 13% of PN but 11% of pediatricians versus 26% of PN consult social media instead of scientific sources for their vaccine update. The investigation on the pHCPs attitudes to vaccination in a personal and family setting highlights poor adherence to vaccinations. Only 63% of pediatricians versus 16% of PN (p < 0.0001) annually received the Flu vaccine. In their family setting 93% of pediatricians versus 51% of PN recommended all vaccinations (p < 0.0001). Anti-flu, anti-rotavirus, anti-zoster and anti-pneumococcal vaccines were not regularly recommended by all pHCPs due to doubts of uselessness (55% of pediatricians versus 40% of PN) and preference for natural immunity (44% of pediatricians versus 40% of PN). Conclusions Our results indicate that pHCPs' attitude and confidence in regards to vaccines remain suboptimal. Current COVID-19 pandemic and the rapid development of vaccines could increase vaccine hesitancy.

This decision by the regulators is based on data from a study published in The Lancet which presented the results of an interim analysis of 4 very heterogeneous randomized trials. This analysis shows that this vaccine reduces the relative risk of developing symptomatic, mostly benign Covid-19 by 62.1 % (CI95 = 41.0-75.7) with the two doses provided in the protocol and by 90.0 % (CI95 = 67.4-97.0) when the first dose was half of that expected (subgroup and post-hoc analysis = exploratory result to be confirmed). These reductions should be put into perspective with a risk of between 1.56 % and 1.62 % observed in control subjects. These results do not mean that 62.1% or 90.0% of vaccinated subjects are protected. There is no conclusive evidence in people aged >= 65 years on the spread of the virus, nor on the duration of immunity and protection.

Also, COVID-19 risk perception and beliefs toward COVID-19 vaccine benefits and barriers were assessed. Results: A total of 2,208 participants completed the survey with a participation rate of 13.1%.

COVID-19 risk perception, and perceived vaccine benefits, and barriers were significant predictors of intention. Among those undecided or unwilling to take the COVID-19 vaccine, its safety and side effects were the most common concerns.

In the United States, health care systems and governmental agencies have relied on several models, such as the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, Youyang Gu (YYG), Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ensemble, to predict short- and long-term trends in disease activity. The Mayo Clinic Bayesian SIR model, recently made publicly available, has informed Mayo Clinic practice leadership at all sites across the United States and has been shared with Minnesota governmental leadership to help inform critical decisions during the past year. One key to the accuracy of the Mayo Clinic model is its ability to adapt to the constantly changing dynamics of the pandemic and uncertainties of human behavior, such as changes in the rate of contact among the population over time and by geographic location and now new virus variants. The Mayo Clinic model can also be used to forecast COVID-19 trends in different hypothetical worlds in which no vaccine is available, vaccinations are no longer being accepted from this point forward, and 75% of the population is already vaccinated. Surveys indicate that half of American adults are hesitant to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, and lack of understanding of the benefits of vaccination is an important barrier to use. The focus of this paper is to illustrate the stark contrast between these 3 scenarios and to demonstrate, mathematically, the benefit of high vaccine uptake on the future course of the pandemic.

We evaluate SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses after Sputnik V vaccination of healthcare workers in Argentina, measuring IgG anti-spike titers and neutralizing capacity after one and two doses in a cohort of naive or previously infected volunteers. By 21 days after receiving the first dose of the vaccine, 94% of naive participants develop spike-specific IgG antibodies. A single Sputnik V dose elicits higher antibody levels and virus-neutralizing capacity in previously infected individuals than in naive ones receiving the full two-dose schedule.

However, a significant proportion of people report that they do not intend to have a vaccine, often because of concerns they have about vaccine side effects or safety. This study will assess the impact of theory-based messages on COVID-19 vaccination intention, drawing on the Necessity-Concerns framework to address previously reported beliefs and concerns about COVID-19 vaccination, and assess whether hypothesised variables (illness coherence, perceived necessity and concerns) mediate change in vaccination intention. Trial design: Prospective, parallel two-arm, individually randomised (1:1) trial. Participants: Adults aged over 18 years, living in Scotland and not vaccinated for COVID-19. A quota sampling approach will be used with the aim of achieving a nationally representative sample on gender, region and ethnic group, with oversampling of individuals with no educational qualifications or with only school-level qualifications. Intervention and comparator: Intervention: Brief exposure to online text and image-based messages addressing necessity beliefs and concerns about COVID-19 vaccination. Comparator: Brief exposure to online text and image-based messages containing general information about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccination. Main outcomes: Primary outcome: Self-reported intention to receive a vaccine for COVID-19 if invited, immediately post-intervention. Secondary outcomes: Self-reported COVID-19 illness coherence, perceived necessity of a COVID-19 vaccine and concerns about a COVID-19 vaccine, immediately post-intervention. Randomisation: Quasi-randomisation performed automatically by online survey software, by creating a variable derived from the number of seconds in the minute that the participant initiates the survey. Participants starting the survey at 0-14 or 30-44 seconds in the minute are allocated to the intervention and 15-29 or 45-59 seconds to the comparator. Blinding (masking): Participants will not be blinded to group assignment but will not be informed of the purpose of the study until they have completed the follow-up survey. Investigators will be blinded to allocation as all procedures will be undertaken digitally and remotely without any investigator contact with participants.

Much of this attention is on work in epidemiology, virology and public health, with most behavioural advice in public health focusing squarely on 'proximate' determinants of behaviour. While epidemiological models are powerful tools to predict the spread of disease when human behaviour is stable, most do not incorporate behavioural change. The evolutionary basis of our preferences and the cultural evolutionary dynamics of our beliefs drive behavioural change, so understanding these evolutionary processes can help inform individual and government decision-making in the face of a pandemic. Lay summary: The COVID-19 pandemic has brought behavioural sciences into the public eye: Without vaccinations, stopping the spread of the virus must rely on behaviour change by limiting contact between people. On the face of it, stop seeing people sounds simple. In practice, this is hard. Here we outline how an evolutionary perspective on behaviour change can provide additional insights. Evolutionary theory postulates that our psychology and behaviour did not evolve to maximize our health or that of others. Instead, individuals are expected to act to maximise their inclusive fitness (i.e, spreading our genes) - which can lead to a conflict between behaviours that are in the best interests for the individual, and behaviours that stop the spread of the virus. By examining the ultimate explanations of behaviour related to pandemic-management (such as behavioural compliance and social distancing), we conclude that good of the group arguments and one size fits all policies are unlikely to encourage behaviour change over the long-term. Sustained behaviour change to keep pandemics at bay is much more likely to emerge from environmental change, so governments and policy makers may need to facilitate significant social change - such as improving life experiences for disadvantaged groups.",,,,"Ge, Erhao/AAV-7723-2021; Arnot, Megan/AAG-8228-2019","Arnot, Megan/0000-0002-6293-5202; Campbell, Olympia L K/0000-0001-8818-637X; Emmott, Emily/0000-0003-4862-179X; Nila, Sarah/0000-0002-3985-4949; Peacey, Sarah/0000-0003-0532-1770; Chen, Yuan/0000-0002-7069-1631; Micheletti, Alberto Jacopo Cesare/0000-0001-7062-2655; Mace, Ruth/0000-0002-6137-7739",,,,,,,,,,,,,2050-6201,,,,OCT 24,2020,,1,,,,,264,278,,10.1093/emph/eoaa038,,,,,,,WOS:000605229900001,33318799,,,,,,,,

The present study aimed to summarize economic evaluation evidence of preventing strategies, programs, and treatments of COVID-19. Material and methods: We searched Medline/PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science Core Collection, Embase, Scopus, Google Scholar, and specialized databases of economic evaluation from December 2019 to July 2020 to identify relevant literature to economic evaluation of programs against COVID-19. Two researchers screened titles and abstracts, extracted data from full-text articles, and did their quality assessment by the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) checklist. Then, quality synthesis of results was done. Results: Twenty-six studies of economic evaluations met our inclusion criteria. The CHEERS scores for most studies (n = 9) were 85 or higher (excellent quality). Eight studies scored 70 to 85 (good quality), eight studies scored 55 to 70 (average quality), and one study < %55 (poor quality). The decision-analytic modeling was applied to twenty-three studies (88%) to evaluate their services. Most studies utilized the SIR model for outcomes. In studies with long-time horizons, social distancing was more cost-effective than quarantine, nonintervention, and herd immunity. Personal protective equipment was more cost-effective in the short-term than non-intervention. Screening tests were cost-effective in all studies. Conclusion: The results suggested screening tests and social distancing to be cost-effective alternatives in pre venting and controlling COVID-19 on a long-time horizon.

However, the landscape in which people are making COVID-19 vaccination decisions has recently evolved with releases of encouraging vaccine-related data and changes to official messaging about the virus. Therefore, this study sought to identify factors associated with reported likelihood to get vaccinated for COVID-19 among US adults in late January 2021. Study design: We used the Prolific online research panel to survey a nationally representative sample of 1017 US adults. Methods: Respondents were asked about their behavioral intentions toward COVID-19 vaccination, trust in science, perceptions related to COVID-19, and selected sociodemographic factors. We computed associations between those 11 independent variables and likelihood to get vaccinated for COVID-19 using multiple linear regression. Results: Around 73.9% of respondents indicated at least some likelihood to get vaccinated for COVID-19. Trust in science and perceived seriousness of COVID-19 were positively associated with intention to get vaccinated, and identifying as Black or African American was negatively associated with intention to get vaccinated. Other factors were moderately, weakly, or not at all associated with intention. Conclusions: Building trust in science and truthfully emphasizing the seriousness of catching COVID-19 should be further researched for their potential to support campaigns to encourage COVID-19 vaccination.

Key factors for willingness to get vaccinated were male gender, living in a country with a high mortality rate in comparison with low mortality, being not infected with COVID-19, having high level of knowledge about COVID-19 vaccines and having been vaccinated for influenza in the last 2 years. Moreover, trusting the government and doctors regarding the information about the COVID-19 and having high level of fear about this virus were key factors for willingness to get vaccinated. Conclusion Vaccination of healthcare personnel is a crucial issue not only for their own safety but also for their patients'. Healthcare acceptance to get vaccinated can work as a role model for general population. Relevance to clinical practice Gender, country, mortality rate, trust in government and health professionals and the level of fear were key factors that should be managed in clinical practice.",,,,,"Argyriadis, Alexandros/0000-0001-5754-4787; Laredo Aguilera, Jose Alberto/0000-0002-3661-3584",,,,,,,,,,,,0962-1067,1365-2702,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1111/jocn.15980,,JUL 2021,,,,,WOS:000678845200001,34309114,,,,,,,,

Their health-related quality of life status needs to be assessed, as lower levels could affect their functioning. In order to evaluate the current status of community pharmacists' quality of life from Romania and Bulgaria during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to identify factors associated with their decision on being vaccinated to prevent COVID-19, an online survey involving 395 community pharmacists was conducted from 15th July 2020 to 15th August 2020. The 15D instrument was used for quality-of-life assessment. The pharmacists' recommendations for vitamin C and D intake during the COVID-19 pandemic were also analyzed in order to promote future training programs for community pharmacists. Descriptive statistics, comparative analyses between pharmacists from Romania and Bulgaria, and multiple correlation analyses were performed on the collected data. Significant differences were observed for the level of quality of life between the two groups of pharmacists according to their age; smaller values, directly correlated with their age (total 15D score and age: Spearman r = 0.168, p = 0.022), were obtained for Bulgarian pharmacists regarding sleeping, usual activities, mental function, discomfort and symptoms, depression, distress. The perception of being vaccinated did not differ between Romanian and Bulgarian pharmacists, as almost 50% agreed to vaccination (p = 0.7542). Their willingness to vaccinate was correlated with vitamin D usage (p = 0.0134), rather than with vitamin C (p = 0.4157). No other significant associations were found between willingness to get vaccinated to prevent COVID-19 and other characteristics (age, gender, income, quality-of-life markers).

This study investigated: (1) the prevalence of behavioral intention of COVID-19 vaccination (BICV) under eight scenarios combining vaccines' effectiveness/safety/cost, plus two general scenarios of free/self-paid vaccination given governmental/hospital recommendations, (2) perceptions involving preferred timing of COVID-19 vaccination and impacts of various attributes on BICV, and (3) factors of BICV based on the Health Belief Model. An anonymous online cross-sectional survey was conducted among 2,254 full-time doctors/nurses in three Chinese provinces during 10/2020-11/2020. The prevalence of BICV was 75.1%/68.0% among nurses/doctors under the most optimum scenario of this study (free/80% effectiveness/rare mild side effects); it dropped to 64.6%/56.5% if it costed 600 Yuan (USD90). Similar prevalence was obtained (72.7%/71.2%) if the vaccination was recommended by the government/hospitals but dropped to <50% if effectiveness was 50% or mild side effects were common; 13.0% preferred to take up COVID-19 vaccination at the soonest (81.8% would wait and see). Scientific proof (completion of phase III clinical trials and approval from health authorities) was rated the highest in its impacts on vaccination decision, followed by vaccines' performance, and then logistics. Multivariable logistic regression analyses showed that perceived severity, perceived barriers, cues to action, and self-efficacy (but neither perceived susceptibility nor perceived barriers) were significantly associated with the two BICV outcomes.

METHODS: In May 2020, we recruited 2164 US parents and guardians of children ages 6 months to 5 years to complete a brief online survey that examined parental behavior and decision-making in response to experimental stimuli and real-world events. We estimated a multivariate multinomial logistic regression (controlling for key demographics) to assess the relationship between a child's 2019-2020 influenza vaccination status and the COVID-19 pandemic's influence on a parent's intentions for their child's 2020-2021 influenza vaccination. RESULTS: Changes in vaccination intentions significantly differed between parents whose children received the 2019-2020 influenza vaccine compared with those whose children did not (P < .001). Specifically, among parents whose children did not receive the 2019-2020 vaccine, 34% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 30%-37%) reported that the COVID-19 pandemic made them less likely to have their child receive the 2020-2021 vaccine. Among those whose children did receive the 2019-2020 vaccine, this figure was just 24% (95% CI: 22%-27%). Conversely, only 21% (95% CI: 18%-24%) of parents whose children did not receive the 2019-2020 vaccine reported that the COVID-19 pandemic made them more likely to have their child receive the 2020-2021 vaccine, compared with 39% (95% CI: 36%-41%) of parents whose children did receive the 2019-2020 vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic alone does not appear sufficient to encourage the uptake of pediatric seasonal influenza vaccination. Instead, the COVID-19 pandemic may exacerbate polarity in vaccination uptake.

There are still no approved agents for disease prophylaxis. We thus decided to use a drug repositioning strategy to perform a state-of-the-art review of a promising but controversial drug, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), in an effort to provide an objective, scientific and methodologically correct overview of its potential prophylactic role. The advantage of using known drugs is that their toxicity profile is well known and there are fewer commercial interests (e.g., expired patents), thus allowing the scientific community to be freer of constraints. The main disadvantage is that the economic resources are almost always insufficient to promote large multinational clinical trials. In the present study, we reviewed the literature and available data on the prophylactic use of HCQ. We also took an in-depth look at all the published clinical data on the drug and examined ongoing clinical trials (CTs) from the most important CT repositories to identify a supporting rationale for HCQ prophylactic use. Our search revealed a substantial amount of preclinical data but a lack of clinical data, highlighting the need to further assess the translational impact of in vitro data in a clinical setting. We identified 77 CTs using a multiplicity of HCQ schedules, which clearly indicates that we are still far from reaching a standard of care. The majority of the CTs (92%) are randomized and 53% are being conducted in a phase 3 or 2/3 setting. The comparator is placebo or control in 55 (77%) of the randomized studies. Forty-eight (62%) CTs expect to enroll up to 1,000 subjects and 50 (71%) plan to recruit healthcare workers (HCW). With regard to drug schedules, 45 (58.5%) CTs have planned a loading dose, while 18 (23.4%) have not; the loading dose is 800 mg in 19 trials (42.2%), 400 mg in 19 (42.2%), 600 mg in 4 (8.9%) and 1,200 mg in 1 (2.2%). Forty trials include at least one daily schedule, while 19 have at least one weekly schedule. Forty-one (53.2%) will have a treatment duration of more than 30 days. Awaiting further developments that can only derive from the results of these prospective randomized CTs, the take-home message of our review is that a correct methodological approach is the key to understanding whether prophylactic HCQ can really represent an effective strategy in preventing COVID-19.",,,,"Farolfi, Alberto/AAH-9762-2019; Donati, Caterina/ABA-4908-2021; Monti, Manuela/AAF-1101-2021","Farolfi, Alberto/0000-0002-3289-8041; Donati, Caterina/0000-0002-7076-3340; Monti, Manuela/0000-0002-3587-1768; Cerchione, Claudio/0000-0002-9104-5436",,,,,,,,,,,,1663-9812,,,,,DEC 3,2020,11,,,,,,,,605185,10.3389/fphar.2020.605185,,,,,,,WOS:000599271900001,33343376,,,,,,,,

It has been suggested that BCG vaccination of infants against tuberculosis in LMICs might be providing cross-protection against COVID-19. BCG has never been routinely administered in the United States and is not currently administered in most other developed countries. Some epidemiology studies, known as ecologic studies have provided support for the idea that BCG is protecting against COVID-19. However, ecologic studies, with group (i.e., country) measures of exposure and health outcomes, are difficult to interpret in terms of cause and effect. More interpretable are studies that use individual-person measures of exposure and health outcome. We carried out such a study using data from several hundred-thousand U.S. military Veterans, many of whom were born in LMICs and would have received BCG vaccination as infants. Many U.S. Veterans have had COVID-19, and many of those have died of it. Our study, the first of its kind, found no evidence to support the idea that infant BCG vaccination protects against infection or death from COVID-19. In the early stages of the COVID-19 global pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) appeared to be experiencing lower morbidity and mortality rates than high-income countries, particularly the United States. Various suggestions put forward to account for this included the possibility that LMICs might be experiencing off-target benefits of infant vaccination with BCG, intended primarily to protect against tuberculosis. A number of ecologic epidemiological studies that considered COVID-19 morbidity and mortality rates across countries appeared to support this suggestion. Ecologic studies, however, are primarily hypothesis-generating, given their well-known limitations in extrapolating to the individual-person level. The present study, which employed anonymized records of U.S. Military Veterans treated by the Department of Veterans Affairs was principally a case-control study of COVID-19 infections with a retrospective cohort study of mortality nested within the infections. Controls were a random sample of Veterans not recorded as having had COVID-19. There were 263,039 controls and 167,664 COVID-19 cases, of whom 5,016 died. The combination of country and year of birth was used as a surrogate for infant BCG vaccination. The study did not support the hypothesis that BCG in infancy was protective against COVID-19. The odds ratio for infection was 1.07 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03, 1.11) and the risk ratio for mortality among the COVID-19 cases was 0.86 (95% CI: 0.63, 1.18). The potential for non-differential exposure misclassification was a concern, possibly biasing measures of association toward the null value.",,,,"Bates, Michael/ABC-2050-2021",,,,,,,,,,,,,2164-5515,2164-554X,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1080/21645515.2021.1981084,,OCT 2021,,,,,WOS:000707084100001,34643480,,,,,,,,

There was no study evaluation nor quantification synthesis, due to the large heterogeneity of the studies. Nineteen databases were selected. 73 publications were considered and 33 were selected, to which 12 more were added. Results: Globally, the proportion of men and women who tested positive is comparable. However, men are about 60 % more likely to be severely ill or to die from the complications of Covid-19 than are women. Limitations: The study was hampered by a large heterogeneity in testing and reporting of the data. Conclusions: Although in the pandemic men die more frequently than women from Covid-19, it is not clear whether this is due to biological differences between men and women, differences in behavioral habits, or differences in the rates of co-morbidities.

Delivering COVID-19 treatment services in crisis settings will likely entail complex trade-offs between offering services of clinical benefit and minimising risks of nosocomial infection, while allocating resources appropriately and safeguarding other essential services. This paper outlines considerations for humanitarian actors planning COVID-19 treatment services where vaccination is not yet widely available. We suggest key decision-making considerations: allocation of resources to COVID-19 treatment services and the design of clinical services should be based on community preferences, likely opportunity costs, and a clearly articulated package of care across different health system levels.

In this pandemic situation, all the people's lives of 212 Countries and Territories have been affected due to partial or complete lockdown and also as a result of mandatory isolations or quarantines. This is due to the non-availability of any secure vaccine. Objective: The present study helps us to identify and screen the best phytochemicals as potent inhibitors against COVID-19. Methods: In this paper, we choose two standard drugs namely hamamelitannin and rosmarinic acid as a probable inhibitor of pandemic COVID-19 receptor as compared to antimalarial drugs hydroxychloroquine, anti-viral drug remdesivir, and also baricitinib. This study was done by taking into consideration of molecular docking study, performed with Auto Dock 4.0 (AD4.0). All chemical structures were optimized with the Avogadro suite by applying the MMFF94 force field and also hamamelitannin, rosmarinic acid was optimized using the Gaussian G16 suite of UB3LYP/6-311++ G(d,p) basis set. Protein-ligand interaction was visualized by PyMOL software. Results: This work has provided an insightful understanding of protein-ligand interaction of hamamelitannin and rosmarinic acid showing comparable binding energies than that of clinically applying probable COVID-19 inhibitors hydroxychloroquine (an anti-malarial drug) and remdesivir (an anti-viral drug). Conclusion: We will expect that if its anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity is validated in human clinical trials, these two drugs may be developed as an effective antiviral therapeutics towards infected patients in this outbreak and pandemic situation of COVID-19.",,,,"Das, Rajesh/AAP-4276-2020","Das, Rajesh/0000-0001-9433-4711; SARKAR, KAUSHIK/0000-0002-3782-0948",,,,,,,,,,,,1570-1808,1875-628X,,,,,2021,18,1,,,,,67,75,,10.2174/1570180817999200802032126,,,,,,,WOS:000631151000006,,,,,,,,,

Understanding the distribution of disease at the national level contributes to the formulation of public health policies. There are several studies that investigating the influencing factors on distribution of COVID-19 in China. However, more influencing factors need to be considered to improve our understanding about the current epidemic. Moreover, in the absence of effective medicine or vaccine, the Chinese government introduced a series of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). However, assessing and predicting the effectiveness of these interventions requires further study. In this paper, we used statistical techniques, correlation analysis and GIS mapping expression method to analyze the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics and the influencing factors of the COVID-19 in mainland China. The results showed that the spread of outbreaks in China's non-Hubei provinces can be divided into five stages. Stage I is the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak; in stage II the new peak of the epidemic was observed; in stage III the outbreak was contained and new cases decreased; there was a rebound in stage IV, and stage V led to level off. Moreover, the cumulative confirmed cases were mainly concentrated in the southeastern part of China, and the epidemic in the cities with large population flows from Wuhan was more serious. In addition, statistically significant correlations were found between the prevalence of the epidemic and the temperature, rainfall and relative humidity. To evaluate the NPIs, we simulated the prevalence of the COVID-19 based on an improved SIR model and under different prevention intensity. It was found that our simulation results were compatible with the observed values and the parameter of the time function in the improved SIR model for China is a=- 0.0058. The findings and methods of this study can be effective for predicting and managing the epidemics and can be used as an aid for decision makers to control the current and future epidemics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2045-2322,,,,,FEB 12,2021,11,1,,,,,,,3717,10.1038/s41598-021-83166-4,,,,,,,WOS:000620250900009,33580113,,,,,,,,

Governments, decision-makers and policy-makers broadly need information about the effectiveness of a control intervention concerning its cost-benefit to evaluate whether a control intervention offers the best value for money. The outbreak of COVID-19 in December 2019, and the eventual spread to other parts of the world, have pushed governments and health authorities to take drastic socioeconomic, sociocultural and sociopolitical measures to curb the spread of the virus, SARS-CoV-2. To help policy-makers, health authorities and governments, we propose a Susceptible, Exposed, Asymptomatic, Quarantined asymptomatic, Severely infected, Hospitalized, Recovered, Recovered asymptomatic, Deceased, and Protective susceptible (individuals who observe health protocols) compartmental structure to describe the dynamics of COVID-19. We fit the model to real data from Ghana and Egypt to estimate model parameters using standard incidence rate. Projections for disease control and sensitivity analysis are presented using MATLAB. We noticed that multiple peaks (waves) of COVID-19 for Ghana and Egypt can be prevented if stringent health protocols are implemented for a long time and/or the reluctant behaviour on the use of protective equipment by individuals are minimized. The sensitivity analysis suggests that: the rate of diagnoses and testing, the rate of quarantine through doubling enhanced contact tracing, adhering to physical distancing, adhering to wearing of nose masks, sanitizing-washing hands, media education remains the most effective measures in reducing the control reproduction number R-c, to less than unity in the absence of vaccines and therapeutic drugs in Ghana and Egypt. Optimal control and cost-effectiveness analysis are rigorously studied. The main finding is that having two controls (transmission reduction and case isolation) is better than having one control, but is economically expensive. In case only one control is affordable, then transmission reduction is better than case isolation. Hopefully, the results of this research should help policy-makers when dealing with multiple waves of COVID-19. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Multiple risk factors of disease progression requiring hospitalization have been identified, but medical decision-making remains complex. Objective To characterize a large cohort of patients hospitalized with COVID-19, their outcomes, develop and validate a statistical model that allows individualized prediction of future hospitalization risk for a patient newly diagnosed with COVID-19. Design Retrospective cohort study of patients with COVID-19 applying a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression algorithm to retain the most predictive features for hospitalization risk, followed by validation in a temporally distinct patient cohort. The final model was displayed as a nomogram and programmed into an online risk calculator. Setting One healthcare system in Ohio and Florida. Participants All patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 between March 8, 2020 and June 5, 2020. Those tested before May 1 were included in the development cohort, while those tested May 1 and later comprised the validation cohort. Measurements Demographic, clinical, social influencers of health, exposure risk, medical co-morbidities, vaccination history, presenting symptoms, medications, and laboratory values were collected on all patients, and considered in our model development. Results 4,536 patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during the study period. Of those, 958 (21.1%) required hospitalization. By day 3 of hospitalization, 24% of patients were transferred to the intensive care unit, and around half of the remaining patients were discharged home. Ten patients died. Hospitalization risk was increased with older age, black race, male sex, former smoking history, diabetes, hypertension, chronic lung disease, poor socioeconomic status, shortness of breath, diarrhea, and certain medications (NSAIDs, immunosuppressive treatment). Hospitalization risk was reduced with prior flu vaccination. Model discrimination was excellent with an area under the curve of 0.900 (95% confidence interval of 0.886-0.914) in the development cohort, and 0.813 (0.786, 0.839) in the validation cohort.

There are many arguments for the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in pregnant women. The aim of this study is to conduct a systematic review concerning the approach of pregnant women towards vaccination against COVID-19, with particular regard to determinants of vaccination acceptance. Materials and Methods: Articles were reviewed in which the aim was to evaluate-via a survey or questionnaire-the acceptance and decision to undergo vaccination against COVID-19. The articles were subjected to review according to recommendations of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Statement (PRISMA). Results: In various studies, the percentage of pregnant women accepting the COVID-19 vaccine was between 29.7% and 77.4%. The strongest factors co-existing with the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy were trust in the importance and effectiveness of the vaccine, explicit communication about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines for pregnant women, acceptance of other vaccinations such as those for influenza, belief in the importance of vaccines/mass vaccination in one's own country, anxiety about COVID-19, trust in public health agencies/health science, as well as compliance to mask guidelines. The remaining factors were older age, higher education, and socioeconomic status. Conclusions: This review allowed us to show that geographic factors (Asian, South American countries) and pandemic factors (different threats and risks from infection) significantly influence the acceptance of vaccines. The most significant factors affecting acceptance are those related to public awareness of the risk of infection, vaccine safety, and the way in which reliable information about the need and safety of vaccines is provided. Professional and reliable patient information by obstetricians and qualified medical personnel would significantly increase the level of confidence in vaccination against COVID-19.",,,,,"Januszek, Rafal/0000-0002-6591-1919; Kluz, Tomasz/0000-0002-4798-3986",,,,,,,,,,,,1010-660X,1648-9144,,,,SEP,2021,57,9,,,,,,,977,10.3390/medicina57090977,,,,,,,WOS:000699489600001,34577900,,,,,,,,

However, reliable, timely data based on representative population sampling are unavailable, and reported case and test positivity rates are highly biased. A simple data-driven Bayesian semi-empirical modeling framework was developed and used to evaluate state-level prevalence and seroprevalence of COVID-19 using daily reported cases and test positivity ratios. The model was calibrated to and validated using published state-wide seroprevalence data, and further compared against two independent data-driven mathematical models. The prevalence of undiagnosed COVID-19 infections is found to be well-approximated by a geometrically weighted average of the positivity rate and the reported case rate. Our model accurately fits state-level seroprevalence data from across the U.S. Prevalence estimates of our semi-empirical model compare favorably to those from two data-driven epidemiological models. As of December 31, 2020, we estimate nation-wide a prevalence of 1.4% [Credible Interval (CrI): 1.0%-1.9%] and a seroprevalence of 13.2% [CrI: 12.3%-14.2%], with state-level prevalence ranging from 0.2% [CrI: 0.1%-0.3%] in Hawaii to 2.8% [CrI: 1.8%-4.1%] in Tennessee, and seroprevalence from 1.5% [CrI: 1.2%-2.0%] in Vermont to 23% [CrI: 20%-28%] in New York. Cumulatively, reported cases correspond to only one third of actual infections. The use of this simple and easy-to-communicate approach to estimating COVID-19 prevalence and seroprevalence will improve the ability to make public health decisions that effectively respond to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Author summary Timely and reliable estimates of COVID-19 prevalence and seroprevalence are paramount for evaluating the spread and control of the pandemic in different US states. Relying on reported cases and test positivity rates individually can result in incorrect inferences as to the spread of COVID-19 and ill-informed public health decision-making. Our study developed a simple semi-empirical model for estimating state-level prevalence and seroprevalence of COVID-19 in the United States (US) using reported case and test positivity rates data. We found that due to the preferential nature of diagnostic COVID-19 testing in the US, the geometric mean of reported case and test positivity rates is an accurate predictor of undiagnosed COVID-19 prevalence and trends.",,,,,"Ndeffo Mbah, Martial/0000-0003-4158-7613; Chiu, Weihsueh/0000-0002-7575-2368",,,,,,,,,,,,1553-734X,1553-7358,,,,SEP,2021,17,9,,,,,,,,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009374,,,,,,,WOS:000697187000009,34491990,,,,,,,,

In the current sub-Saharan Africa context, still marked by uncertainty surrounding the spread of COVID-19, we present the protocol of an ongoing longitudinal study aimed at investigating COVID-19-related attitudes, risks perceptions, preventive behaviours and economic impact in rural areas in Senegal. Methods and analysis A prospective randomised longitudinal study of 600 households located in three semiurban villages and nine randomly selected rural villages in the Niakhar area (located 135 km East of Dakar). Three ad hoc phone surveys are administered to 600 heads of households, their housewives in charge of managing the household and a relative living temporarily in the household, respectively. In addition to sharing identical sets of questions on several topics (risks perceptions, attitudes to curfew, attitudes to vaccines, beliefs about COVID-19 infection), the three separate survey questionnaires also include other topics (economic impact, local preventive strategies) whose related questions differ between questionnaires. As analysing evolutions is the study's primary focus, data on all the topics covered will be collected in three waves unless the spread of COVID-19 by mid-2021 justifies extending data collection. The present article presents the study protocol and details about the implementation of the first wave of data collection which started in July 2020. The decision to wait before presenting the protocol was based on the unprecedented context the COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods: In 184 serum samples from 130 COVID-19 patients and 54 SARS-CoV-2 negative subjects, the analytical and clinical performances of four commercially available chemiluminescent assays (Abbott SARS-Cov-2 IgG, Roche Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2, Ortho SARS-CoV-2 total and IgG) and one enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Diesse ENZY-WELL SARS-CoV-2 IgG) were evaluated and compared with the neutralization activity achieved using the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Findings: Precision results ranged from 0.9% to 11.8% for all assays. Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated linearity of results at concentrations within the cut-off value. Overall, sensitivity ranged from 78.5 to 87.7%, and specificity, from 97.6 to 100%. On limiting the analysis to samples collected 12 days after onset of symptoms, the sensitivity of all assays increased, the highest value (95.2%) being obtained with VITRO Anti-SARSCoV-2 Total and Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG. The strongest PRNT50 correlation with antibody levels was obtained with ENZY-Well SARS-CoV-2 IgG (R(2)adj = 0.569). Interpretation: The results confirmed that all immunoassays had an excellent specificity, whereas sensitivity varied across immunoassays, depending strongly on the time interval between symptoms onset and sample collection. Further studies should be conducted to achieve a stronger correlation between antibody measurement and PRNT50 in order to obtain useful information for providing a better management of COVID-19 patients, effective passive antibody therapy, and developing a vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

This study sought to: (1) identify potential vaccine uptake rates among New Zealanders prior to programme rollout; (2) understand reasons for unlikelihood/likelihood of vaccine uptake; and, (3) explore sociodemographic differences in risk of and reasons for vaccine hesitancy. Methods: Data were collected in March 2021 ( n = 1,284) via a web-based survey. Respondents were a diverse sample of New Zealanders who were part of a large, pre-existing social research sampling frame. Multinomial and logit regressions were estimated to examine sociodemographic predictors of vaccine hesitancy and reasons for likelihood/hesitancy. Findings: Overall, 70% reported they would likely take the vaccine once available (i.e., very likely or somewhat likely). Being younger and less educated were correlated with greater vaccine hesitancy risk (i.e., very unlikely, somewhat likely, or unsure). Women were more likely than men to say they were unsure ( Relative Risk Ratio = 1.60) vs. either likely or unlikely and to identify concerns regarding personal health, such as potential side effects, as a reason. Men identified concerns surrounding trust in vaccines and the perceived exaggerated risk of COVID-19 to them and the population. Interpretation: Although a majority intend to take the COVID-19 vaccine once available, a sizeable minority who were more likely to be young, female, and less educated, were unsure about or unlikely to get the vaccine, primarily due to perceptions of unknown future side effects. Ethnicity was not statistically associated with vaccine hesitancy, suggesting that public health effort s aimed at increasing vaccine acceptance among M a over line ori and Pacific peoples-subgroups most at-risk of COVID-19 infection and morbidity-should focus on inequities in health care access to increase uptake.

An anonymous survey was made available from November 2020 to February 2021 to representatives of patient organizations through social media (Facebook) and to patients in the Chemotherapy Department of the Clinical Hospital in Poznan. The survey was completed by 836 patients. The majority of the survey respondents had cancer (77%, n = 644), and almost 1/5 of the respondents indicated hypertension (15.7%, n = 131) as well as depression and/or anxiety disorders (11.1%, n = 93). Results. Less than half of the respondents (43.5%, n = 364) believed that SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were safe (40.4%, n = 260, among cancer patients; 53.9%, n = 104, among patients with other medical conditions). More than half of the respondents (60.5%, n = 506) intended to be vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 (58.8%, n = 378, among cancer patients; 66.3%, n = 128, among patients with other medical conditions). Fear of vaccine complications and lack of belief in vaccine effectiveness were prevalent among both cancer patients and patients with other medical conditions. Conclusions. The vast majority of cancer and medical patients wanted to be vaccinated against COVID-19. More than half of the respondents did not believe that the COVID-19 vaccine would be safe for them. Education of cancer and medical patients on the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine, as well as the use of additional protective measures against infection, is an extremely important element of prevention during the COVID-19 pandemic.",,,,,"Bartoszkiewicz, Mikolaj/0000-0002-8728-5998",,,,,,,,,,,,1899-5276,2451-2680,,,,AUG,2021,30,8,,,,,805,811,,10.17219/acem/138962,,,,,,,WOS:000691557700005,34286517,,,,,,,,

Knowledge in the field has been increasing exponentially and the main allergy societies have produced guidance documents for better management of allergic patients during this period. However, few publications so far have provided real-life data from the allergy community concerning allergy practice during the COVID-19 outbreak. Therefore, we proposed an international survey on the management of allergic patients during the current pandemic. Methods: We performed an online survey undertaken to reach out the worldwide allergy community by e-mail and social media. The web-based questionnaire contained 24 questions covering demographic data from the participants, clinical practice during this period, and questions related to the new international classification and coding tools addressed for COVID-19. It was circulated for 8 weeks and had anonymous and volunteer context. Results: Data are presented for 635 participants from 78 countries of all continents. Allergists with long-term professional experience were the main audience. As expected, we received many responses as I have no data or I don't know to the questions of the survey. However, most with more experience on managing allergic patients during the pandemic agreed that patients suffering from allergic or hypersensitivity conditions have no increased risk of contracting COVID-19 or developing SARS CoV-2. Also, participants mentioned that none of the allergy treatments (inhaled corticosteroids, allergen immunotherapy, biological agents increased the risk of contracting COVID-19 infection including severe presentations. Conclusion: The data presented are a starting point in the process of getting feedback on all the recommendations provided by the allergy societies; it could also be the basis of new strategies to support health professionals while new COVID-19 specific treatments and vaccines are being explored. The information here presented intends to be helpful to the community but represents a course of action in a highly specific situation due to the state of emergency, and it should be helpful to health systems.",,,,"Wong, Gary WK/AAY-9207-2020","Wong, Gary WK/0000-0001-5939-812X; Caminati, Marco/0000-0001-7383-1487; Ebisawa, Motohiro/0000-0003-4117-558X; Peden, David/0000-0003-4526-4627; Rouadi, philip/0000-0002-5365-9568",,,,,,,,,,,,1939-4551,,,,,FEB,2021,14,2,,,,,,,100515,10.1016/j.waojou.2021.100515,,,,,,,WOS:000632209300001,33552380,,,,,,,,

On the face of ongoing death and destruction, the urgent need for the discovery of a vaccine against the virus is paramount. This study resorted to the emerging discipline of immunoinformatics in order to design a multi-epitope mRNA vaccine against the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. Various immunoinformatics tools were utilized to predict T and B lymphocyte epitopes. The epitopes were channeled through a filtering pipeline comprised of antigenicity, toxicity, allergenicity, and cytokine inducibility evaluation with the goal of selecting epitopes capable of generating both T and B cell-mediated immune responses. Molecular docking simulation between the epitopes and their corresponding MHC molecules was carried out. 13 epitopes, a highly immunogenic adjuvant, elements for proper sub-cellular trafficking, a secretion booster, and appropriate linkers were combined for constructing the vaccine. The vaccine was found to be antigenic, almost neutral at physiological pH, non-toxic, non-allergenic, capable of generating a robust immune response and had a decent worldwide population coverage. Based on these parameters, this design can be considered a promising choice for a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we present and discuss the findings of four selected medicinal plants (Nigella sativa, Vernonia amygdalina, Azadirachta indica, Eurycoma longifolia), with reported antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory effects that might be interesting for further investigation. Our findings showed that only A. indica reported positive antiviral evidence specific to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) based on preliminary in silico data while all four medicinal plants demonstrated differential anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory effects. The definitive roles of these medicinal plants in cytokine storms and post-infection complications remains to be further investigated.

In this editorial, we will first explore the nature of public vaccine hesitancy, review what is known and demonstrate the significance of understanding vaccine hesitancy in the COVID-19 context. We argue that sociological research indicates that to sufficiently grasp vaccine hesitancy in the twenty-first century it is necessary to consider several aspects: the nature of medical decision-making, trust, risk and social responsibility, and the role of information technology and various forms of media. There are also questions about what influences the (successful) development and provision of a vaccine - issues that have been brought sharply into focus by the COVID-19 pandemic. As such, in the second half of the editorial, we move to consider the supply side of vaccination.

Trials for both antivirals and vaccines are in progress; candidates include existing repurposed drugs that were originally developed for other ailments. Once these are shown to be effective, their production will need to be ramped up rapidly to keep pace with the growing demand as the pandemic progresses. It is highly likely that the drugs will be in short supply in the interim, which leaves policymakers and medical personnel with the difficult task of determining how to allocate them. Under such conditions, mathematical models can provide valuable decision support. In particular, useful models can be derived from process integration techniques that deal with tight resource constraints. In this paper, a linear programming model is developed to determine the optimal allocation of COVID-19 drugs that minimizes patient fatalities, taking into account additional hospital capacity constraints. Two hypothetical case studies are solved to illustrate the computational capability of the model, which can generate an allocation plan with outcomes that are superior to simple ad hoc allocation.

Concern regarding vaccine safety and efficacy, lack of awareness regarding their eligibility for vaccination and lack of trust in government agencies predicted COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among medical students. On the other hand, the presence of risk perception regarding themselves being affected with COVID-19 reduced vaccine hesitancy as well as hesitancy in participating in COVID-19 vaccine trials. Vaccine-hesitant students were more likely to derive information from social media and less likely from teachers at their medical colleges. Choosing between the two available vaccines (Covishield and Covaxin) was considered important by medical students both for themselves and for their future patients. Covishield was preferred to Covaxin by students. Majority of those willing to take the COVID-19 vaccine felt that it was important for them to resume their clinical posting, face-to-face classes and get their personal life back on track. Around three-fourths medical students viewed that COVID-19 vaccine should be made mandatory for both health care workers and international travellers.

One important question is whether healthcare workers (HCWs) should receive priority access to a vaccine in the event that an effective vaccine becomes available. This question is especially relevant in the coronavirus pandemic with governments and health authorities currently facing questions of distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. Main text In this article, we critically evaluate the most common ethical arguments for granting healthcare workers priority access to a vaccine. We review the existing literature on this topic, and analyse both deontological and utilitarian arguments in favour of HCW prioritisation. For illustrative purposes, we focus in particular on the distribution of a COVID-19 vaccine. We also explore some practical complexities attendant on arguments in favour of HCW prioritisation. Conclusions We argue that there are deontological and utilitarian cases for prioritising HCWs.

The lack of approved drugs for severe COVID-19 makes repurposing or repositioning of approved drugs a relevant approach because it occurs at lower costs and in a shorter time. Most preclinical and clinical tests, including safety and pharmacokinetic profiles, were already performed. However, infective and inflammatory diseases such as COVID-19 are linked with hypoalbuminemia and downregulation of both phase I and phase II drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters, which can occur in modifications of pharmacokinetics and consequentially of safety profiles. This appears to occur in a sex- and gender-specific way because of the sex and gender differences present in the immune system and inflammation, which, in turn, reflect on pharmacokinetic parameters. Therefore, to make better decisions about drug dosage regimens and to increases the safety profile in patients suffering from infective and inflammatory diseases such as COVID-19, it is urgently needed to study repurposing or repositioning drugs in men and in women paying attention to pharmacokinetics, especially for those drugs that are previously scarcely evaluated in women.",,,,,"CAMPESI, ILARIA/0000-0002-1681-6448",,,,,,,,,,,,,1424-8247,,,,AUG,2021,14,8,,,,,,,730,10.3390/ph14080730,,,,,,,WOS:000689847500001,34451827,,,,,,,,

However, no effective drugs or vaccines have been developed so far. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has been considered as a promising supplementary treatment of this disease due to its clinically proven performance in many severe diseases, like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Meanwhile, many reports suggest that the side-effects (SE) of TCM prescriptions cannot be ignored in treating COVID-19 as it often leads to dramatic degradation of the patients' physical condition. Systematic evaluation of TCM regarding its latent SE becomes a burning issue. Aim: In this study, we used an ontology-based side-effect prediction framework (OSPF) developed from our previous work and Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based deep learning, to evaluate the TCM prescriptions officially recommended by China for the treatment of COVID-19. Materials and methods: The OSPF developed from our previous work was implemented in this study, where an ontology-based model separated all ingredients in a TCM prescription into two categories: hot and cold. A database was created by converting each TCM prescription into a vector which contained ingredient dosages, corresponding hot/cold attribution and safe/unsafe labels. This allowed for training of the ANN model. A safety indicator (SI), as a complement to SE possibility, was then assigned to each TCM prescription. According to the proposed SI, from high to low, the recommended prescription list could be optimized. Furthermore, in interest of expanding the potential treatment options, SIs of other well-known TCM prescriptions, which are not included in the recommended list but are used traditionally to cure flu-like diseases, are also evaluated via this method. Results: Based on SI, QFPD-T, HSBD-F, PMSP, GCT-CJ, SF-ZSY, and HSYF-F were the safest treatments in the recommended list, with SI scores over 0.8. PESP, QYLX-F, JHQG-KL, SFJD-JN, SHL-KFY, PESP1, XBJ-ZSY, HSZF-F, PSSP2, FFTS-W, and NHSQ-W were the prescriptions most likely to be unsafe, with SI scores below 0.1. In the additional lists of other TCM prescriptions, the indicators of XC-T, SQRS-S, CC-J, and XFBD-F were all above 0.8, while QF-Y, XZXS-S, BJ-S, KBD-CJ, and QWJD-T's indicators were all below 0.1. Conclusions: In total, there were 10 TCM prescriptions with indicators over 0.8, suggesting that they could be considered in treating COVID-19, if suitable. We believe this work could provide reasonable suggestions for choosing proper TCM prescriptions as a supplementary treatment for COVID-19. Furthermore, this work in-troduces a novel and informative method which could help create recommendation list of TCM prescriptions for the treatment of other diseases.",,,,"Wang, Zeheng/G-4109-2019","Wang, Zeheng/0000-0002-6994-1234",,,,,,,,,,,,0378-8741,1872-7573,,,,MAY 23,2021,272,,,,,,,,113957,10.1016/j.jep.2021.113957,,,,,,,WOS:000629344400002,33631276,,,,,,,,

We propose how to evaluate suspected severe allergic reactions to the vaccines so that as many as possible may be safely vaccinated. Recent findings Rare cases of severe allergic reactions after COVID-19 vaccination have been observed, seemingly at a higher frequency than for other vaccines. Few excipients are likely to have caused these reactions. IgE-mediated reactions to polyethylene glycol (PEG) and its derivatives are the most suspected, albeit hitherto unproven, causes. We suggest to make a diagnosis based on skin tests with PEG and PEG derivatives and that these be considered in relation to the decisions required before the first and the second vaccine dose. A vaccine without these excipients is available, but published data about its side effects are limited. The underlying immunological mechanisms of the rare severe allergic reactions to the COVID-19 vaccines are poorly understood and need to be clarified. Identifying those who have an undiagnosed allergy to PEG and PEG derivatives is crucial before vaccination, and these substances are found in laxatives, cosmetics and in 30% of all our medications today.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1528-4050,1473-6322,,,,AUG,2021,21,4,,,,,401,409,,10.1097/ACI.0000000000000762,,,,,,,WOS:000668271600013,34091550,,,,,,,,

This paper presents an optimization strategy for the allocation of COVID-19 vaccines, when they are available, through different fairness schemes (social welfare, Nash, Rawlsian justice, and social welfare II scheme). The applicability of the proposed model is illustrated using the case study of Mexico, including the states of the country as stakeholders. We involve several parameters to guide the allocation, such as the size, risk profiles, and fraction of vulnerable groups in the population. Furthermore, different scenarios of the availability of potential COVID-19 vaccines were evaluated. The social welfare approach is the most commonly used scheme for the allocation of resources. However, we demonstrate that this scheme yields non-unique or multiple solutions (through the social welfare II approach). These social welfare approaches provide inequalities in the allocations that become critical when resources are scarce. Specifically, the social welfare scheme favors large stakeholders (greater population) in all scenarios. We also observe how the complexity of the allocation increases with the higher availability of vaccines. Hence, it is relevant to consider allocation schemes to identify fair solutions.",,,,,"PONCE-ORTEGA, JOSE MARIA/0000-0002-3375-0284",,,,,,,,,,,,2509-4238,2509-4246,,,,MAR,2021,5,1,,,,,3,12,,10.1007/s41660-020-00141-8,,JAN 2021,,,,,WOS:000607504300002,,,,,,,,,
J,"Eberhardt, J; Ling, J",,,,"Eberhardt, Judith; Ling, Jonathan",,,Predicting COVID-19 vaccination intention using protection motivation theory and conspiracy beliefs,VACCINE,,,,,,,,,,,,"Background: While COVID-19 vaccine uptake has been encouraging overall, some individuals are either hesitant towards, or refuse, the vaccine. Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) has been applied to influenza vaccine acceptance, but there is a lack of research applying PMT to COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Additionally, prior research has suggested that coronavirus conspiracy beliefs and demographic factors may play a role in attitudes towards the vaccine. This study aimed to predict COVID-19 vaccination intention using PMT, coronavirus conspiracy beliefs, and demographic factors. Furthermore, vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals were compared in relation to their coronavirus conspiracy beliefs. Methods: An online survey was administered to 382 (278 vaccinated, and 104 unvaccinated) individuals in the United Kingdom (77 males, 301 females, one non-binary/third gender, and three unstated). Respondents' mean age was 43.78 (SD = 12.58). Results: A hierarchical multiple linear regression was performed in three stages. Initially, four PMT constructs severity, susceptibility, maladaptive response costs, and self-efficacy emerged as significant predictors of COVID-19 vaccination intention. The final model accounted for 75% of the variance and retained two significant predictors from PMT maladaptive response rewards and self-efficacy- along-side coronavirus conspiracy beliefs and age. An independent t-test established that unvaccinated individuals held greater coronavirus conspiracy beliefs than vaccinated ones. Conclusions: Interventions and campaigns addressing COVID-19 vaccine acceptance should employ strategies increasing individuals' perceived severity of COVID-19, perceived susceptibility, and perceived ability to get vaccinated, while decreasing perceived rewards of not getting vaccinated. Additionally, coronavirus conspiracy beliefs should be addressed, as these appear to play a role for some vaccine hesitant individuals. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Design/methodology/approach Through a cross-sectional survey design, the study adopted a quantitative approach to data collection and analysis. The study used an online survey to collect data from 478 respondents eligible to take the COVID-19 vaccine in Ghana. Findings Attitude, social norm, perceived behavioural control, perceived susceptibility and cues to action were found to be predictors of COVID-19 vaccination intention. The results also showed that perceived severity, perceived benefits and perceived barriers did not predict COVID-19 vaccination intention. Practical implications To enhance the effectiveness of COVID-19 social marketing campaigns, social marketing theories such as the TPB and HBM can aid in assessing the intention of the target population to take the vaccines. An assessment of vaccination intention will help understand disease threat perception and behavioural evaluation. The consideration of the effect of demography on vaccination intention will aid in developing effective campaigns to satisfy the needs of segments. Originality/value This study adds to the limited research on understanding citizens' intention to vaccinate against COVID-19 by combining the TPB and HBM to predict vaccination intention.

In this study, we examined the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine by health care workers, their concerns about it, and the reasons that might prevent them from getting vaccinated. We conducted a crosssectional study using an anonymous online survey from December 25, 2020, to January 6, 2021. The questionnaire consisted of demographic characteristics (age, gender, profession, sector, medical history, and general health), COVID-19 related knowledge, and personal history of influenza vaccination. The intention to get the vaccine once it is available was directly asked, and attitudes towards the diseases and the vaccine were studied using a four-point Likert scale statement based on the health belief model's constructs. The study included 1159 HCWs; 62.9% were females, and 52.5% were between the ages of 30-49 years. The intention to get vaccinated was only 37.8% [95%CI: 35.0%-40.6%], while 31.5% were undecided, and 30.7% planned to refuse it. Higher levels of intention were reported among males (OR; 2.7, 95%CI: 2.0-3.7), younger ages (OR 1.7, 95%CI: 1.1-2.8), physicians (OR; 2.9, 95%CI: 2.0-4.0), HCWs at non-governmental settings (OR; 1.4, 95%CI: 1.1-1.9), those who previously received the influenza vaccine (OR 4.0, 95%CI: 2.3-7.1), and those who had higher COVID-19 related knowledge (OR; 1.7, 95%CI: 2.3-7.1).

Uganda reported 40,751 cases and 335 deaths as of 9 April 2021 and started its vaccination program among priority groups like health workers, teachers, those with chronic diseases among others in early March 2021. Unanimous uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine is required to subsequently avert its spread; therefore, we assessed COVID-19 vaccine acceptability, hesitancy, and associated factors among medical students in Uganda. Methods This study employed an online descriptive cross-sectional survey among medical students across 10 medical schools in Uganda. A structured questionnaire via Google Form was conveniently sent to eligible participants via WhatsApp. Each medical school had a coordinator who consistently shared the data tool in the WhatsApp groups. Chi-square or Fisher's exact test, and logistic regression were used to assess the association between vaccine acceptability with demographics, COVID-19 risk perception, and vaccine hesitancy. Results We surveyed 600 medical students, 377 (62.8%) were male. COVID-19 vaccine acceptability was 37.3% and vaccine hesitancy 30.7%. Factors associated with vaccine acceptability were being male (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.9, 95% CI 1.3-2.9, p=0.001) and being single (aOR= 2.1, 95% CI 1.1-3.9, p=0.022).

However, there is a dearth of literature exploring family experiences of-or concerns related to-childhood vaccinations that gives voice to vaccine hesitant caregivers (VHCs) of small children. Here, we present insights from VHCs from the Philippines. Methods This research draws on in-depth interviews (IDIs) with 44 VHCs who had previously delayed or refused vaccination for their children in rural and urban communities in Cavite Province, the Philippines. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted IDIs via an online platform of the respondents' choosing (ie, Facebook messenger call, Skype and Zoom). All interviews were recorded, transcribed, translated and analysed drawing from the tenets of constructivist grounded theory. We use the social ecological model to structure our results. Results Among the reasons for delay or refusal of childhood vaccinations, a fear of side effects emerged as the most salient concern, exacerbated by previous negative experiences (including trauma) from a dengue vaccine controversy in 2017. Respondents cited the dengue vaccine controversy as they expressed reluctance (regarding any new vaccines) and suspicion (towards school-based vaccination, the distribution channel used for the dengue vaccine). Heads of households opposing vaccines, perceptions that vaccines are non-essential and influences from the social and traditional media or neighbours contributed to further refusal and delay. Upon probing, VHCs recounted health system concerns particularly with regards to healthcare workers who are sometimes unable to answer their questions and can be dismissive or disrespectful regarding caregivers' concerns. Conclusion Understanding VH from the lens of VHCs highlights pathways for interventions to regain trust and bolster confidence towards vaccines.

Choosing an ideal in-vitro model is vital as the virus entry is through ACE2, CD147, and TMPRSS2 dependant and very specific. In this regard, this is the first systematic review addressing the importance of specific cell lines used as potential in-vitro models in the isolation, pathogenesis, and therapeutics for SARS COV-2. Methods: We searched 17 literature databases with appropriate keywords, and identified 1173 non-duplicate studies. In the present study, 71 articles are included after a careful, thorough screening of the titles and their abstracts for possible inclusion using predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria (PRISMA Guidelines). Results: In the current study, we compiled cell culture-based studies for SARS-CoV-2 and found the best compatible In-Vitro models for SARS-CoV-2 (Vero, VeroE6, HEK293 as well as its variants, Huh-7, Calu-3 2B4, and Caco2).

Potential improvements could be pointed out such as dilution reduction in lysis, and potential reduction of necessary chromatography steps. 1 g pDNA may lead to about 30 g mRNA. This shifts the bottleneck towards the mRNA processing step, which points out co-transcriptional capping as a preferred option to reduce the number of purification steps. Purity demands are fulfilled by a combination of mixed-mode and reversed-phase chromatography as established unit operations on a higher industrial readiness level than e.g., precipitation and ethanol-chloroform extraction. As a final step, lyophilization was chosen for stability, storage and transportation logistics. Alternative process units like UF/DF (ultra-/diafiltration) integration would allow the adjustment of final concentration and buffer composition before lipid-nano particle (LNP) formulation. The complete digital twin is proposed for further validation in manufacturing scale and utilization in process optimization and manufacturing operations. The first PAT results should be followed by detailed investigation of different batches and processing steps in order to implement this strategy for process control and reliable, efficient operation.",,,,"Schmidt, Axel/J-2733-2017","Schmidt, Axel/0000-0002-3750-470X",,,,,,,,,,,,,2227-9717,,,,MAY,2021,9,5,,,,,,,748,10.3390/pr9050748,,,,,,,WOS:000654551600001,,,,,,,,,

Patients' access to specialist clinics and family medicine clinics was limited. In this situation, pharmacists were likely the first option for patient's health information. On 18 March 2020, the National Health Fund issued modifications that increased the accessibility to primary health care such as telemedicine. The development of e-health in Poland during the COVID-19 pandemic included the implementation of electronic medical records (EDM), telemedicine development, e-prescription, and e-referrals implementation. We investigated this emergency's effect on patients' health habits, access to healthcare, and attitude to vaccination. Materials and methods: An anonymous study in the form of an electronic and paper questionnaire was conducted in March 2021 among 926 pharmacies patients in Poland. The content of the questionnaire included access to medical care, performing preventive examinations, implementation of e-prescriptions, patient satisfaction with telepathing, pharmaceutical care, and COVID-19 vaccination. Results: During the COVID-19 pandemic, 456 (49.2%) patients experienced worse access to a doctor. On the other hand, 483 (52.2%) patients did not perform preventive examinations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Almost half of the patients (45.4% (n = 420)) were not satisfied with the teleconsultation visit to the doctor. A total of 90% (n = 833) of the respondents do not need help in making an appointment with a doctor and buying medications prescribed by a doctor in the form of an e-prescription. In the absence of access to medical consultation, 38.2% (n = 354) of respondents choose the Internet as a source of medical advice. However, in the absence of contact with a doctor, 229 persons (24.7%) who took part in the survey consulted a pharmacist. In addition, 239 persons (25.8%) used pharmacist advice more often during the COVID-19 pandemic than before its outbreak on 12 March 2020. Moreover, 457 (49.4%) respondents are satisfied with the advice provided by pharmacists, and even 439 patients of pharmacies (47.4%) expect an increase in the scope of pharmaceutical care in the future, including medical advice provided by pharmacists. Most of the respondents, 45.6% (n = 422), want to be vaccinated in a hospital or clinic, but at the same time, for a slightly smaller number of people, 44.6% (n = 413), it has no meaning where they are will be vaccinated against COVID-19. Conclusions: Telemedicine is appreciated by patients but also has some limitations. The COVID-19 pandemic is the chance for telemedicine to transform from implementations to a routine healthcare system structure. However, some patients still need face-to-face contact with the doctor or pharmacist. Pharmacists are essential contributors to public health and play an essential role during the COVID-19 pandemic. Integration of pharmaceutical care with public health care and strong growth in the professional group of pharmacists may have optimized patient care.",,,,"; Wiatrak, Benita/T-3402-2018","Szelag, Adam/0000-0001-8104-5267; Wiatrak, Benita/0000-0002-1404-2274; Jeskowiak, Izabela/0000-0002-8829-4482; Grosman-Dziewiszek, Patrycja/0000-0001-7362-6571",,,,,,,,,,,,,2077-0383,,,,SEP,2021,10,18,,,,,,,4211,10.3390/jcm10184211,,,,,,,WOS:000700665500001,34575322,,,,,,,,

Despite the efforts of United States healthcare providers to vaccinate the bulk of its population, vaccine hesitancy is still a severe challenge that has led to the resurgence of COVID-19 cases to over 100,000 people during early August 2021. To our knowledge, there are limited nationwide studies that examined the spatial distribution of vaccination rates, mainly based on the social vulnerability index (SVI). In this study, we compiled a database of the percentage of fully vaccinated people at the county scale across the continental United States as of 29 July 2021, along with SVI data as potential significant covariates. We further employed multiscale geographically weighted regression to model spatial nonstationarity of vaccination rates. Our findings indicated that the model could explain over 79% of the variance of vaccination rate based on Per capita income and Minority (%) (with positive impacts), and Age 17 and younger (%), Mobile homes (%), and Uninsured people (%) (with negative effects). However, the impact of each covariate varied for different counties due to using separate optimal bandwidths.

Guidance on how best to screen patients who are potential organ donors to minimize the risks of COVID-19 as well as how best to manage immunosuppression and reduce the risk of COVID-19 and manage infection in solid organ transplant recipients (SOTr) is needed. Methods. Iterative literature searches were conducted, the last being January 2021, by a team of 3 information specialists. Stakeholders representing key groups undertook the systematic reviews and generation of recommendations using a rapid response approach that respected the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations frameworks. Results. The systematic reviews addressed multiple questions of interest. In this guidance document, we make 4 strong recommendations, 7 weak recommendations, 3 good practice statements, and 3 statements of no recommendation. Conclusions. SOTr and patients on the waitlist are populations of interest in the COVID-19 pandemic. Currently, there is a paucity of high-quality evidence to guide decisions around deceased donation assessments and the management of SOTr and waitlist patients.

It considered the outcomes relating to needing a COVID test, self-isolating, whether residents agreed that UK government and NHS-approved vaccines were 'very safe', and whether they had enough information in order to make an informed decision about whether or not to get vaccinated. Modelling these outcomes using multivariate regression produced a range of results that showed that all of the following were important: the impact of age, living in deprived areas, ethnicity, religious affiliation, disability, industry, occupation, economic status, changes in household income, sexual orientation, and household composition. Thus, the results showed that there are complex socioeconomic factors associated with the willingness to get a test, self-isolate, and the levels of vaccine hesitancy, such that, in future ensuring that (re-)vaccination and 'track and trace' programmes are successful, may need to be better nuanced by references to such factors rather than adopting programmes that mostly just rely on age as the criteria for roll-outs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2076-393X,,,,JUL,2021,9,7,,,,,,,759,10.3390/vaccines9070759,,,,,,,WOS:000676990800001,34358175,,,,,,,,

The primary objective of the present study is to examine the role of doctor-patient communication and vaccination. We test the impact of doctor-patient communication on trust in doctors' vaccine recommendations as a mediator, to understand the mechanisms leading to positive vaccination attitudes, and ultimately leading to actual H1N1 vaccination behavior. We use data from a nationally representative U.S. sample from one of the Multimedia Audience Research Systems (MARS) data sets collected by Kantar Media. Our results demonstrate the crucial role of doctor-patient communication in building patients' trust in doctors, which in turn positively impact vaccination attitudes and H1N1 vaccination behavior. Unlike other preventive health measures, getting vaccines after a pandemic is a critical decision because these vaccines are previously unknown. Our finding implies that verified communication from the physician's office may be one of the effective strategies during or after a pandemic.

Although vaccine hesitancy has existed among a small percentage of people for centuries, its harmful effects are likely to be more pronounced during the COVID-19 pandemic than ever before. COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy will pose substantial risks for both people who delay or refuse to be vaccinated and the wider community. It will make communities unable to reach thresholds of coverage necessary for herd immunity against COVID-19, thus unnecessarily perpetuating the pandemic and resulting in untold suffering and deaths. Vaccine hesitancy is pervasive, misinformed, contagious, and is not limited to COVID-19 vaccination. Our work shows that vaccine hesitancy is a complex and dynamic social process that reflects multiple webs of influence, meaning, and logic. People's vaccination views and practices usually comprise an ongoing engagement that is contingent on unfolding personal and social circumstances, which can potentially change over time.

Prioritising healthcare workers may have intuitive appeal, but the ethical justifications for doing so and the potential harms that could follow require careful analysis. Ethical justifications commonly offered for healthcare worker prioritisation for ventilators rest on two social value criteria: (1) instrumental value, also known as the 'multiplier effect', which may preserve the ability of healthcare workers to help others, and (2) reciprocity, which rewards past usefulness or sacrifice. We argue that these justifications are insufficient to over-ride the common moral commitment to value each person's life equally. Institutional policies prioritising healthcare workers over other patients also violate other ethical norms of the healthcare professions, including the commitment to put patients first. Furthermore, policy decisions to prioritise healthcare workers for ventilators could engender or deepen existing distrust of the clinicians, hospitals and health systems where those policies exist, even if they are never invoked.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0306-6800,1473-4257,,,,SEP,2021,47,9,,,,,599,602,,10.1136/medethics-2021-107248,,,,,,,WOS:000691004400004,34172525,,,,,,,,

However, there are inequalities in the procurement of vaccines particularly among US ethnic and racial minority males when compared to the rest of the US population. This study explored the reasons given by adult Mexican-origin males residing in Texas, for obtaining or not, immunizations. This was a cross-sectional, exploratory study with a sample of convenience of 401 adult males (age range 18-79) who were invited to participate in the study while waiting their turn to receive administrative services at the Mexican Consulate in Austin Texas. Data was collected in Spanish with a seven-item multiple choice questionnaire, using electronic tablets. The majority of respondents received their last vaccination longer than 5 years earlier. A higher percentage of individuals in the older age groups received a vaccine in the last year, as opposed to their younger counterparts who obtained their last immunization 3 to 5 years earlier. Among the reasons given for not getting vaccinated were lack of time or money, feared injections and side effects, insufficient information, interest or motivation. Others did not get vaccines because they perceived themselves to be healthy and did not feel sick. Findings from this study have important implications for future preventive medicine and vaccination practices that reach socially excluded groups in times of COVID-19.

In this regard, we used a refinement of the SIDARTHE (Susceptible, Infected, Diagnosed, Ailing, Recognized, Threatened, Healed, Extinct) model to develop a retrospective computational analysis focused on an Italian case study. Our work aimed at evaluating the efficacy of adopted countermeasures (inferred from the resulting model parameters), and additionally providing an estimate of the undetected viral circulation as well as the day zero of the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy, which are not directly inferable from the data. Late 2019 saw the outbreak of COVID-19, a respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which rapidly turned into a pandemic, killing more than 2.77 million people and infecting more than 126 million as of late March 2021. Daily collected data on infection cases and hospitalizations informed decision makers on the ongoing pandemic emergency, enabling the design of diversified countermeasures, from behavioral policies to full lockdowns, to curb the virus spread. In this context, mechanistic models could represent valuable tools to optimize the timing and stringency of interventions, and to reveal non-trivial properties of the pandemic dynamics that could improve the design of suitable guidelines for future epidemics. We performed a retrospective analysis of the Italian epidemic evolution up to mid-December 2020 to gain insight into the main characteristics of the original strain of SARS-CoV-2, prior to the emergence of new mutations and the vaccination campaign. We defined a time-varying optimization procedure to calibrate a refined version of the SIDARTHE (Susceptible, Infected, Diagnosed, Ailing, Recognized, Threatened, Healed, Extinct) model and hence accurately reconstruct the epidemic trajectory. We then derived additional features of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy not directly retrievable from reported data, such as the estimate of the day zero of infection in late November 2019 and the estimate of the spread of undetected infection. The present analysis contributes to a better understanding of the past pandemic waves, confirming the importance of epidemiological modeling to support an informed policy design against epidemics to come.",,,,"Giordano, Giulia/L-5209-2015; Domenici, Enrico/K-8194-2016","Giordano, Giulia/0000-0002-8600-1738; Domenici, Enrico/0000-0001-7436-6919; Marchetti, Luca/0000-0001-9043-7705",,,,,,,,,,,,,2079-7737,,,,APR,2021,10,4,,,,,,,311,10.3390/biology10040311,,,,,,,WOS:000642731200001,33917920,,,,,,,,

COVID-19 caused by a novel coronavirus, a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has recently broken out worldwide. Up to now, the development of vaccine is still in the stage of clinical research, and there is no clinically approved specific antiviral drug for human coronavirus infection. The purpose of this study is to investigate the key molecules involved in response during SARSCoV-2 infection and provide references for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. Methods. We conducted in-depth and comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of human proteins identified with SARS-CoV-2, including functional enrichment analysis, protein interaction network analysis, screening of hub genes, and evaluation of their potential as therapeutic targets. In addition, we used the gene-drug database to search for inhibitors of related biological targets. Results. Several significant pathways, such as PKA, centrosome and transcriptional regulation, may greatly contribute to the development and progression of COVID-2019 disease. Taken together 15 drugs and 18 herb ingredients were screened as potential drugs for viral treatment. Specially, the trans-resveratrol can significantly reduce the expression of N protein of MERS-CoV and inhibit MERS-CoV. In addition, transresveratrol, Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) and BX795 all show good anti multiple virus effects. Conclusion. Some drugs selected through our methods have been proven to have antiviral effects in previous studies. We aim to use global bioinformatics analysis to provide insights to assist in the design of new drugs and provide new choices for clinical treatment. (C) 2020 IMSS.

Here we characterize the neutralizing antibodies produced in two subjects who received combination immunizations against SARS-CoV-2, first with Covishield (Oxford-AstraZeneca) vaccine, followed 33 days later with a second dose (booster) shot of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Serum samples were collected 25 days following the primary vaccination and 13 days after the secondary Pfizer vaccination. Both subjects exhibited increased levels of isotype IgG and IgM antibodies directed against the entire spike protein following immunizations. These antibodies also exhibited increased reactivity with the receptor binding domain (RBD) in the spike protein and neutralized the infectivity of replicating vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) that contains the COVID-19 coronavirus S protein gene in place of its normal G glycoprotein. This VSV pseudovirus also contains the reporter gene for enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP). Antibody titers against the spike protein and serum neutralization titers against the reporter virus are reported for the 2 heterologous vaccinated individuals and compared to a positive control derived from a convalescent patient and a negative control from an unexposed individual. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine increased antibody binding to the spike protein and RBD, and approached levels found in the convalescent positive control. Neutralizing antibodies against the VSV-S pseudovirus in the 2 subjects also approached levels in the convalescent sera.

Due to the lack of a vaccine or specific treatment, there are at least three types of interventions used in the first wave of this pandemic: increased alertness and hygiene (e.g. Sweden); identification and isolation of infected people and their contacts (e.g. South Korea); lockdown (e.g. Italy). These interventions are complementary. Choices of the right mix of interventions will vary from society to society and in the same society at different times. The search for a miracle drug is dangerous because it is based on the mistaken belief that any treatment option is better than nothing. Brazilian society will not be able to maintain lockdown for a long period. Naturally, in the near future, regardless of the advice from scientists, doctors and authorities, commerce, services and schools will reopen. In order to implement any strategy aimed to control the pandemic and preserve the economy, the country needs leadership that centralizes and coordinates actions.

Furthermore, there was a great effort to improve the performance of biosensors so that they can detect the pathogenic virus quickly, in reliable and precise way. In this context, we propose a numerical simulation to highlight the important role of the design parameters that can significantly improve the performance of the biosensor, in particular the sensitivity as well as the detection limit. Applied alternating current electrothermal (ACET) force can generate swirling patterns in the fluid within the microfluidic channel, which improve the transport of target molecule toward the reaction surface and, thus, enhance the response time of the biosensor. In this work, the ACET effect on the SARS-CoV-2 S protein binding reaction kinetics and on the detection time of the biosensor was analyzed. Appropriate choice of electrodes location on the walls of the microchannel and suitable values of the dissociation and association rates of the binding reaction, while maintaining the same affinity, with and without ACET effect, are also, discussed to enhance the total performance of the biosensor and reduce its response time. The two-dimensional equations system is solved by the finite element approach.

While questions of vaccine allocation strategies have received significant attention, important questions remain regarding the potential impact of the vaccine given uncertainties regarding efficacy against transmission, availability, timing, and durability. Methods: We adapted a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model to examine the potential impact on hospitalization and mortality assuming increasing rates of vaccine efficacy, coverage, and administration. We also evaluated the uncertainty of the vaccine to prevent infectiousness as well as the impact on outcomes based on the timing of distribution and the potential effects of waning immunity. Findings: Increased vaccine efficacy against disease reduces hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19; however, the relative benefit of transmission blocking varied depending on the timing of vaccine distribution. Early in an outbreak, a vaccine that reduces transmission will be relatively more effective than one introduced later in the outbreak. In addition, earlier and accelerated implementation of a less effective vaccine is more impactful than later implementation of a more effective vaccine. These findings are magnified when considering the durability of the vaccine. Vaccination in the spring will be less impactful when immunity is less durable. Interpretation: Policy choices regarding non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as social distancing and face mask use, will need to remain in place longer if the vaccine is less effective at reducing transmission or distributed slower. In addition, the stage of the local outbreak greatly impacts the overall effectiveness of the vaccine in a region and should be considered when allocating vaccines. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

Healthcare professionals use different scoring systems as a part of their decision-making so the medical teams and triage committees can allocate resources for predictable health outcomes and prognosis as well as to appropriately triage the patients accordingly. However, the value of the existing scoring systems to manage COVID-19 cases is not well-established yet. Part of this problem includes managing non-COVID patients with chronic medical conditions like non-communicable diseases and addressing their medical needs during the pandemic complex context in a way to avoid worsening their conditions and, on the other hand, avoid hindering the establishment of comprehensive standards for dealing with COVID-19.

Parents were willing to pay US$228-$291 for a vaccine for themselves and US$243-US$321 for their children. A positive impact on WTP was found with self-reported parent health status but not children. The findings of this study have important implications for policy programs which require detailed cost-benefit analyses. WTP for a COVID-19 vaccine is crucial to determine the partial benefits of vaccinating to reduce the risk of repetitive widespread outbreaks.",,,,"Catma, Serkan/AAW-7122-2021","catma, serkan/0000-0002-7996-1271; , Diana/0000-0003-3587-0383",,,,,,,,,,,,2164-5515,2164-554X,,,,SEP 2,2021,17,9,,,,,2919,2925,,10.1080/21645515.2021.1919453,,APR 2021,,,,,WOS:000646131000001,33929290,,,,,,,,

Travel restriction and home/office quarantine are some frequently utilized non-pharmaceutical interventions, which bring the worst crisis of airline industry compared with other transport modes. Therefore, the post-recovery of global air transport is extremely important, which is full of uncertainty but rare to be studied. The explicit/implicit interacted factors generate difficulties in drawing insights into the complicated relationship and policy intervention assessment. In this paper, a Causal Bayesian Network (CBN) is utilized for the modelling of the post-recovery behaviour, in which parameters are synthesized from expert knowledge, open-source information and interviews from travellers. The tendency of public policy in reaction to COVID-19 is analyzed, whilst sensitivity analysis and forward/backward belief propagation analysis are conducted. Results show the feasibility and scalability of this model. On condition that no effective health intervention method (vaccine, medicine) will be available soon, it is predicted that nearly 120 days from May 22, 2020, would be spent for the number of commercial flights to recover back to 58.52%?60.39% on different interventions.

OBJECTIVE To assess US adults' preferences regarding COVID-19 vaccine prioritization. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This survey study involved 2 independent, online surveys of US adults aged 18 years and older, 1 conducted by Gallup from September 14 to 27, 2020, and the other conducted by the COVID Collaborative from September 19 to 25, 2020. Samples were weighted to reflect sociodemographic characteristics of the US population. EXPOSURES Respondents were asked to prioritize groups for COVID-19 vaccine and to rank their prioritization considerations. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The study assessed prioritization preferences and agreement with the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine's Preliminary Framework for Equitable Allocation of COVID-19 Vaccine. RESULTS A total of 4735 individuals participated, 2730 (1474 men [54.1%]; mean [SD] age, 59.2 [14.5] years) in the Gallup survey and 2005 (944 men [47.1%]; 203 participants [21.5%] aged 55-59 years) in the COVID Collaborative survey. In both the Gallup COVID-19 Panel and COVID Collaborative surveys, respondents listed health care workers (Gallup, 93.6% [95% CI, 91.2%-95.3%]; COVID Collaborative, 80.0% [95% CI, 78.0%-81.9%]) and adults of any age with serious comorbid conditions (Gallup, 78.6% [95% CI, 75.2%-81.7%]; COVID Collaborative, 72.9% [95% CI, 70.7%-74.9%]) among their 4 highest priority groups. Respondents of all political affiliations agreed with prioritizing Black, Hispanic, Native American, and other communities that have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 (Gallup, 74.2% [95% CI, 70.6%-77.5%]; COVID Collaborative, 84.9% [95% CI, 83.1%-86.5%]), and COVID Collaborative respondents were willing to be preceded in line by teachers and childcare workers (92.5%; 95% CI, 91.2%-93.7%) and grocery workers (85.9%; 95% CI, 84.2%-87.5%). Older respondents in both surveys were significantly less likely than younger respondents to prioritize healthy adults aged 65 years and older among their 4 highest priority groups (Gallup, 23.7% vs 39.1% [chi(2) = 2160.8; P < .001]; COVID Collaborative, 23.3% vs 28.8% [chi(2) = 5.0198; P = .03]). COVID Collaborative respondents believed the 4 most important considerations for prioritization were preventing COVID-19 spread (78.4% [95% CI, 76.3%-80.3%]), preventing the most deaths (72.1% [95% CI, 69.9%-74.2%]), preventing long-term complications (68.9% [66.6%-71.9%]), and protecting frontline workers (63.8% [95% CI, 61.5%-66.1%]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE US adults broadly agreed with the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine's prioritization framework. Respondents endorsed prioritizing racial/ethnic communities that are disproportionately affected by COVID-19, and older respondents were significantly less likely than younger respondents to endorse prioritizing healthy people older than 65 years. This provides reason for caution about COVID-19 vaccine distribution plans that prioritize healthy adults older than a cutoff age without including those younger than that age with preexisting conditions, that aim solely to prevent the most deaths, or that give no priority to frontline workers or disproportionately affected communities.",,,,,"Largent, Emily/0000-0002-7536-5077",,,,,,,,,,,,2574-3805,,,,,APR 9,2021,4,4,,,,,,,e217943,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.7943,,,,,,,WOS:000638288000009,33835172,,,,,,,,

The present work employs state of art computational methods like homology modelling, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations to evaluate the potential of two widely used surfactant drugs namely chenodeoxycholate(CDC) and ursodeoxycholate (UDC), to bind to the envelope protein of SARS-Cov2(SARS-Cov2-E).The monomeric unit of SARS-Cov2-E was modelled from a close homologue (>90% sequence identity) and a pentameric assembly was modelled using symmetric docking, followed by energy minimization in a DPPC membrane environment. The minimized structure was used to generate best scoring SARS-Cov2-E-CDC/UDC complexes through blind docking. These complexes were subjected to 230 ns molecular dynamics simulations in triplicates in a DPPC membrane environment. Comparative analyses of structural properties and molecular interaction profiles from the MD trajectories revealed that, both CDC and UDC could stably bind to SARS-Cov2-E through H-bonds, water-bridges and hydrophobic contacts with the transmembrane-channelresidues.T30 was observed to be a key residue for CDC/UDC binding. CDC/UDC binding affected the H-bonding pattern between adjacent monomeric chains, slackening the compact transmembrane region of SARS-Cov2-E. Additionally, the polar functional groups of CDC/UDC facilitated entry of a large number of water molecules into the channel. These observations suggest CDC/UDC as potential candidates to hinder the survival of SARS-Cov2 by disrupting the structure of SARS-Cov2-E and facilitating the entry of solvents/polar inhibitors inside the viral cell.

There is a realistic expectation that the global effort in vaccination will bring the pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) under control. Nonetheless, uncertainties remain about the type of long-term association that the virus will establish with the human population and, in particular, whether coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) will become an endemic disease. Although the trajectory is difficult to predict, the conditions, concepts and variables that influence this transition can be anticipated. Persistence of SARS-CoV-2 as an endemic virus, perhaps with seasonal epidemic peaks, may be fuelled by pockets of susceptible individuals and waning immunity after infection or vaccination, changes in the virus through antigenic drift that diminish protection and re-entries from zoonotic reservoirs. Here we review relevant observations from previous epidemics and discuss the potential evolution of SARS-CoV-2 as it adapts during persistent transmission in the presence of a level of population immunity. Lack of effective surveillance or adequate response could enable the emergence of new epidemic or pandemic patterns from an endemic infection of SARS-CoV-2.

At least three COVID-19 vaccines have been approved or are about to be approved for distribution in many countries. However, with very limited initial availability, only a minority of the population will be able to receive vaccines this winter. Urgent decisions will have to be made about who should receive priority for access. Current policy in the UK appears to take the view that those who are most vulnerable to COVID-19 should get the vaccine first. While this is intuitively attractive, we argue that there are other possible values and criteria that need to be considered. These include both intrinsic and instrumental values. The former are numbers of lives saved, years of life saved, quality of the lives saved, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and possibly others including age. Instrumental values include protecting healthcare systems and other broader societal interests, which might require prioritizing key worker status and having dependants. The challenge from an ethical point of view is to strike the right balance among these values. It also depends on effectiveness of different vaccines on different population groups and on modelling around cost-effectiveness of different strategies. It is a mistake to simply assume that prioritizing the most vulnerable is the best strategy. Although that could end up being the best approach, whether it is or not requires careful ethical and empirical analysis.",,,,,"Savulescu, Julian/0000-0003-1691-6403; Wilkinson, Dominic/0000-0003-3958-8633",,,,,,,,,,,,0269-9702,1467-8519,,,,MAY,2021,35,4,,,,,348,355,,10.1111/bioe.12858,,FEB 2021,,,,,WOS:000616013700001,33559129,,,,,,,,

Enhanced surveillance systems for early threat detection will be crucial to maximizing response time for implementation of public health measures and mobilization of resources in containing an emerging pandemic. Recent outbreaks have been dominated by viral pathogens, with RNA respiratory viruses being the most likely to have pandemic potential. These should therefore be a preparedness priority. Tools in the areas of virology, drug discovery, clinical pharmacology, translational medicine and pharmacometrics should be considered key components in the rapid identification and development of existing and novel interventions for a pandemic response. Prioritization of therapeutics should be based on in vitro activity, likelihood of achieving effective drug concentrations at the site of action, and safety profile at the doses that will be required for clinical efficacy. Deployment strategies must be tailored to the epidemiology of the disease, and the adequacy of the response should be re-evaluated in view of evolving epidemiological factors. An interdisciplinary framework integrating drug pharmacology, viral kinetics, epidemiology and health economics could help optimize the deployment strategy by improving decision-making around who to treat, when to treat, and with what type of intervention for optimal outcomes.

To contain the COVID-19 pandemic, a critical decision is the extent to which policy makers rely on voluntary as opposed to enforced compliance, and nations vary along this dimension. While enforcement may secure higher compliance, there is experimental and other evidence that it may also crowd out voluntary motivation. How does enforcement affect citizens' support for anti-COVID-19 policies? A survey conducted with 4,799 respondents toward the end of the first lockdown in Germany suggests that a substantial share of the population will support measures more under voluntary than under enforced implementation. Negative responses to enforcement-termed control aversion-vary across the nature of the policy intervention (e.g., they are rare for masks and frequent for vaccination and a cell-phone tracing app). Control aversion is less common among those with greater trust in the government and the information it provides, and among those who were brought up under the coercive regime of East Germany. Taking account of the likely effectiveness of enforcement and the extent to which near-universal compliance is crucial, the differing degrees of opposition to enforcement across policies suggest that for some anti-COVID-19 policies an enforced mandate would be unwise, while for others it would be essential. Similar reasoning may also be relevant for policies to address future pandemics and other societal challenges like climate change.",,,,,"Schmelz, Katrin/0000-0001-9979-3044",,,,,,,,,,,,0027-8424,,,,,JAN 5,2021,118,1,,,,,,,e2016385118,10.1073/pnas.2016385118,,,,,,,WOS:000607270100045,33443149,,,,,,,,

A randomized controlled trial generally provides the most credible evaluation of a treatment, but the efficiency and effectiveness of the trial depend on the existing evidence supporting the treatment. The researcher must therefore compile a body of evidence justifying the use of time and resources to further investigate a treatment hypothesis in a trial. An observational study can provide this evidence, but the lack of randomized exposure and the researcher's inability to control treatment administration and data collection introduce significant challenges. A proper analysis of observational health care data thus requires contributions from experts in a diverse set of topics ranging from epidemiology and causal analysis to relevant medical specialties and data sources. Here we summarize these contributions as 10 rules that serve as an end-to-end introduction to retrospective pharmacoepidemiological analyses of observational health care data using a running example of a hypothetical COVID-19 study. A detailed supplement presents a practical how-to guide for following each rule. When carefully designed and properly executed, a retrospective pharmacoepidemiological analysis framed around these rules will inform the decisions of whether and how to investigate a treatment hypothesis in a randomized controlled trial.

Now, we are entering the second phase of the pandemics in which the spread of the virus needs to be contained within the limits that national health systems can cope with. This second phase of the epidemics is expected to last until a vaccination is available or herd immunity is reached. Long-term management strategies thus need to be developed. Methods: In this paper we present a new agent-based simulation model COVID-19 ABM with which we simulate 4 alternative scenarios for the second new normality phase that can help decision-makers to take adequate control and intervention measures. Results: The scenarios resulted in distinctly different outcomes. A continued lockdown could regionally eradicate the virus within a few months, whereas a relaxation back to 80% of former activity-levels was followed by a second outbreak. Contact-tracing as well as adaptive response strategies could keep COVID-19 within limits. Conclusion: The main insights are that low-level voluntary use of tracing apps shows no relevant effects on containing the virus, whereas medium or high-level tracing allows maintaining a considerably higher level of social activity. Adaptive control strategies help in finding the level of least restrictions.

AmB which is belonged to the polyene group has a wide spectrum in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity against fungi and parasites, resistance to AmB is rare despite extensive use. Recently, some studies focused on the potential antimicrobial action of AmB against some enveloped viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and rubella virus. Coronaviruses are enveloped positive-sense RNA nucleic acid viruses that have club-like spikes, characterized by a distinctive replication strategy; they are round and sometimes pleomorphic shapes. COVID-19 is regarding the new genera of coronaviridae that appear the first time in Wuhan, China, in early December 2019. Due to the continuous spreading of the novel COVID-19 with the exponential rise in death numbers, new therapeutic development is urgent, in general, there are no specific antiviral drugs or vaccines for 2019-novel coronavirus. Hence, this review may serve as an impetus for researchers working in the field of medical microbiology, vaccination, and antiviral drug design by discussion the most recent information about the antiviral action of AmB against COVID-19 infection as well as trying to a deep understanding of major properties, mechanisms of action, immune system responses, and antimicrobial efficiency of AmB. Since AmB is expected to alter the structure of the viral envelope, membrane integrity of cells, and internal cellular organelles, besides its other unique properties such as host immunomodulatory effects, so this review suggested that AmB as an effective anti-fungi drug thus may hold the promise of formulating a novel therapeutic option to treat COVID-19.",,,,"AL-Khikani, Falah Hasan Obayes/AAH-5501-2021","AL-Khikani, Falah Hasan Obayes/0000-0002-8890-7090",,,,,,,,,,,,1817-1737,1998-3557,,,,JUL-SEP,2020,15,3,,,,,118,124,,10.4103/atm.ATM_147_20,,,,,,,WOS:000546364200004,32831932,,,,,,,,

We measured levels of antibodies in convalescent plasma samples using commercially available SARS-CoV-2 detection tests and in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and correlated serological measurements with NAb activity measured using pseudotyped virus particles, which offer the most informative assessment of antiviral activity of patient sera against viral infection. Our data show that a large proportion of convalescent plasma samples have modest antibody levels and that commercially available tests have various degrees of accuracy in predicting NAb activity. We found that the Ortho anti-SARS-CoV-2 total Ig and IgG high-throughput serological assays (HTSAs) and the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay quantify levels of antibodies that strongly correlate with the results of NAb assays and are consistent with gold standard ELISA results. These findings provide immediate clinical relevance to serology results that can be equated to NAb activity and could serve as a valuable roadmap to guide the choice and interpretation of serological tests for SARSCoV-2.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0095-1137,1098-660X,,,,DEC,2020,58,12,,,,,,,e02005-20,10.1128/JCM.02005-20,,,,,,,WOS:000591828800015,32917729,,,,,,,,

Whether they are SARS-CoV-2 intermediate hosts is worthy of great attention. The interaction of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and its acceptor protein ACE2 is an important issue in determining viral host range and cross-species infection, while the binding capacity of Spike protein to ACE2 of different species is unknown. Here, we used the atomic structure model of SARS-CoV-2 and human ACE2 to assess the receptor utilization capacity of ACE2s from 10 kinds of animals. Results show that chimpanzees, domestic cats and cattles are more susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2. Cats in particular, such as pet cats and stray cats, interact very closely with humans, implying the necessity to carefully evaluate the risk of cats during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, based on ACE2(cats)-SARS-CoV-2-RBD model, through high-throughput screening methods using a pool of 30,000 small molecules, eight compounds were selected for binding free energy calculations. All the eight compounds can effectively interfere with the binding of ACE2 and Spike protein, especially Nelfinavir, providing drug candidates for the treatment and prevention of SARS-CoV-2, suggesting further assessment of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of these compounds in cell culture. Although we only reported the results of the simulation, and more laboratory and epidemiological investigation are required. Like cats are a risk factor, we can further detect SARS-CoV-2 according to the susceptibility of different animals, find the potential host of infection, and completely cut off the living space of the virus. Especially, cats could be a choice of animal model for screening antiviral drugs or vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1664-8021,,,,OCT 23,2020,11,,,,,,,,575012,10.3389/fgene.2020.575012,,,,,,,WOS:000585941500001,33193684,,,,,,,,

Since the first reported cases in Wuhan, China, in late December 2019, humans have been under threat from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (previously known as 2019-nCoV), subsequently declared a pandemic. While the world is searching for expedited approval for a vaccine, which may be only pre-ventative and not a cure, physicians and country leaders are considering several concerted clinical trials suggesting that the age-old antimalarial drugs CQ/HCQ could be a potent therapeutic against COVID-19. Based on accumulating scientific reports, here we highlight the possible modes of action of CQ/HCQ that could justify its use against viral infections. Considering the global health crisis of the COVID-19 pan-demic, the option of repurposing old drugs, e.g. CQ/HCQ, particularly HCQ, for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection could be a good choice. CQ/HCQ has diverse modes of action, including alteration of the acidic environment inside lysosomes and late endosomes, preventing endocytosis, exosome release and phagolysosomal fusion, and inhibition of the host cytokine storm. One or more diverse mechanisms might work against viral infections and reduce mortality. As there is no cure for COVID-19, clinical testing of HCQ is urgently required to determine its potency against SARS-CoV-2, as this is the currently available treatment option. There remains a need to find other innovative drug candidates as possible candidates to enter clinical evaluation and testing. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. and International Society of Chemotherapy.

These measures aim to limit the COVID-19 infection rate and reduce the mortality rate of COVID-19. Given we are likely to see local lockdowns until a treatment or vaccine for COVID-19 is available, and their effectiveness depends on public acceptability, it is important to understand public preference for government responses. Methods and analysis Using a discrete choice experiment (DCE), this study will investigate the public's preferences for pandemic responses in the UK. Attributes (and levels) are based on: (1) lockdown measures described in policy documents; (2) literature on preferences for lockdown measures and (3) a social media analysis. Attributes include: lockdown type; lockdown length; postponement of usual non-urgent medical care; number of excess deaths; number of infections; impact on household spending and job losses. We will prepilot the DCE using virtual think aloud interviews with respondents recruited via Facebook. We will collect preference data using an online survey of 4000 individuals from across the four UK countries (1000 per country). We will estimate the relative importance of the attributes, and the trade-offs individuals are willing to make between attributes. We will test if respondents' preferences differ based on moral attitudes (using the Moral Foundation Questionnaire), socioeconomic circumstances (age, education, economic insecurity, health status), country of residence and experience of COVID-19.

Corona was discovered in India on 30 January 2020. To date, in India, 178,014 disease cases were reported with 14,011 deaths by the Indian Government. In the meantime, with an increasing spread speed, the COVID-19 epidemic occurred in other countries. The survival rate for COVID-19 patients who suffer from a critical illness is efficiently and precisely predicted as more fatal cases can be affected in advanced cases. However, over 400 laboratories and clinically relevant survival rates of all present critically ill COVID-19 patients are estimated manually. The manual diagnosis inevitably results in high misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis owing to a lack of experience and prior knowledge. The chapter presents an option for developing a machine-based prognostic model that exactly predicts the survival of individual severe patients with clinical data from different sources such as Kaggle data.gov and World Health Organization with greater than 95% accuracy. The data set and attributes are shown in detail. The reasonableness of such a mere three elements may depend, respectively, on their representativeness in the indices of tissue injury, immunity and inflammation. The purpose of this paper is to provide detailed study from the diagnostic aspect of COVID-19, the work updates the cost-effective and prompt criticality classification and prediction of survival before the targeted intervention and diagnosis, in particular the triage of the vast COVID-19 explosive epidemic. Design/methodology/approach Automated machine learning (ML) provides resources and platforms to render ML available to non-ML experts, to boost efficiency in ML and to accelerate research in machine learning. H2O AutoML is used to generate the results (Dulhare et al., 2020). ML has achieved major milestones in recent years, and it is on which an increasing range of disciplines depend. But this performance is crucially dependent on specialists in human ML to perform the following tasks: preprocess the info and clean it; choose and create the appropriate apps; choose a family that fits the pattern; optimize hyperparameters for layout; and models of computer learning post processes. Review of the findings collected is important. Findings These days, the concept of automated ML techniques is being used in every field and domain, for example, in the stock market, education institutions, medical field, etc. ML tools play an important role in harnessing the massive amount of data. In this paper, the data set relatively holds a huge amount of data, and appropriate analysis and prediction are necessary to track as the numbers of COVID cases are increasing day by day. This prediction of COVID-19 will be able to track the cases particularly in India and might help researchers in the future to develop vaccines. Researchers across the world are testing different medications to cure COVID; however, it is still being tested in various labs. This paper highlights and deploys the concept of AutoML to analyze the data and to find the best algorithm to predict the disease. Appropriate tables, figures and explanations are provided. Originality/value As the difficulty of such activities frequently goes beyond non-ML-experts, the exponential growth of ML implementations has generated a market for off-the-shelf ML solutions that can be used quickly and without experience. We name the resulting work field which is oriented toward the radical automation of AutoML machine learning. The third class is that of the individuals who have illnesses such as diabetes, high BP, asthma, malignant growth, cardiovascular sickness and so forth. As their safe frameworks have been undermined effectively because of a common ailment, these individuals become obvious objectives. Diseases experienced by the third classification of individuals can be lethal (Shinde et al., 2020). Examining information is fundamental in having the option to comprehend the spread and treatment adequacy. The world needs a lot more individuals investigating the information. The understanding from worldwide data on the spread of the infection and its conduct will be key in limiting the harm. The main contributions of this study are as follows: predicting COVID-19 pandemic in India using AutoML; analyzing the data set predicting the patterns of the virus; and comparative analysis of predictive algorithms. The organization of the paper is as follows, Sections I and II describe the introduction and the related work in the field of analyzing the COVID pandemic. Section III describes the workflow/framework for AutoML using the components with respect to the data set used to analyze the patterns of COVID-19 patients.",,,,"NAIR, RAJIT/R-6595-2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,1708-5284,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1108/WJE-09-2020-0450,,DEC 2020,,,,,WOS:000597995400001,,,,,,,,,

Pediatric patients often rely on parental guidance and decision making, and this may result in a lack of immunization for some children. The availability of the COVID 19 vaccine has been widely anticipated, yet not all individuals will seek the vaccine. Once vaccines are available for children under the age of 16 years, this long-standing pediatric management issue may again emerge and impact public health. The clinical trial efficacy and safety data for children and adolescents less than 16 years of age are not yet available. A traditional approach is to discuss the concerns of the parent in relationship to presentation and review of American Association of Pediatrics (AAP) and CDC guidelines in the framework of medical and scientific explanations. This includes the presentation of efficacy and safety data. Therefore, the use of lab-based antibody testing adds scientific evidence and emphasizes the need for vaccination against SARS CoV-2 and other pathogens. The purpose of this commentary is to propose lab-based testing as a potential adjunctive strategy in addressing this public health concern.

This, in addition to the older age of onset and the higher rate of hospitalization compared to multiple sclerosis, makes this patient group a potential target for complicated COVID-19 infection. Moreover, many of the commonly used preventive therapies for NMOSD are cell-depleting immunouppsressants with increased risk of viral and bacterial infections. The emergence of several new NMOSD therapeutics, including immune-modulating agents, concurrently with the worldwide spread of the COVID-19 global pandemic call for careful therapeutic planning and add to the complexity of NMOSD management. Altering the common therapeutic approach to NMOSD during the pandemic may be necessary to balance both efficacy and safety of treatment. Selection of preventive therapy should take in consideration the viral exposure risk related to the route and frequency of administration and, most importantly, the immunological properties of each therapeutic agent and its potential impact on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and severity of infection. The impact of the therapeutic agent on the immune response against the future SARS-CoV-2 vaccine should also be considered in the clinical decision-making. In this review, we will discuss the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 and evaluate the potential impact of the current and emerging NMOSD therapeutics on infection risk, infection severity, and future SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.

We consider the optimal allocation of a limited supply of a preventive vaccine to control an infectious disease, and four different allocation objectives: minimize new infections, deaths, life years lost, or quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) lost due to death. We consider an SIR model with n interacting populations, and a single allocation of vaccine at time 0. We approximate the model dynamics to develop simple analytical conditions characterizing the optimal vaccine allocation for each objective. We instantiate the model for an epidemic similar to COVID-19 and consider n = 2 population groups: one group (individuals under age 65) with high transmission but low mortality and the other group (individuals age 65 or older) with low transmission but high mortality. We find that it is optimal to vaccinate younger individuals to minimize new infections, whereas it is optimal to vaccinate older individuals to minimize deaths, life years lost, or QALYs lost due to death. Numerical simulations show that the allocations resulting from our conditions match those found using much more computationally expensive algorithms such as exhaustive search. Sensitivity analysis on key parameters indicates that the optimal allocation is robust to changes in parameter values.

Since there are no specific drugs or vaccines, the available tools against COVID-19 are preventive, such as the use of personal protective equipment, social distancing, lockdowns, and mass testing. Such measures are hindered in Brazil due to a restrict budget, low educational level of the population, and misleading attitudes from the federal authorities. Predictions for COVID-19 are of pivotal importance to subsidize and mobilize health authorities' efforts in applying the necessary preventive strategies. The Weibull distribution was used to model the forecast prediction of COVID-19, in four scenarios, based on the curve of daily new deaths as a function of time. The date in which the number of daily new deaths will fall below the rate of 3 deaths per million - the average level in which some countries start to relax the stay-at-home measures - was estimated. If the daily new deaths curve was bending today (i.e., about 1250 deaths per day), the predicted date would be on July 5. Forecast predictions allowed the estimation of overall death toll at the end of the outbreak. Our results suggest that each additional day that lasts to bend the daily new deaths curve may correspond to additional 1685 deaths at the end of COVID-19 outbreak in Brazil (R-2 = 0.9890).

Currently, there is no specific treatment or approved vaccine against COVID-19. The underlying associated comorbidity and diminished immune function of some pituitary patients (whether caused by the disease and its sequelae or treatment with excess glucocorticoids) increases their risk of contracting and developing complications from COVID-19 infection. Methods: A review of studies in PubMed and Google Scholar published between January 2020 to the time of writing (May 1, 2020) was conducted using the search terms 'pituitary,' 'coronavirus,' 'COVID-19', '2019-nCoV', 'diabetes mellitus', 'obesity', 'adrenal,' and 'endocrine.' Results: Older age and pre-existing obesity, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes mellitus increase the risk of hospitalization and death in COVID-19 patients. Men tend to be more severely affected than women; fortunately, most men, particularly of younger age, survive the infection. In addition to general comorbidities that may apply to many pituitary patients, they are also susceptible due to the following pituitary disorder-specific features: hypercortisolemia and adrenal suppression with Cushing disease, adrenal insufficiency and diabetes insipidus with hypopituitarism, and sleep-apnea syndrome and chest wall deformity with acromegaly.

The proposed system utilizes the Internet of Things (IoT) platform to capture users' time-sensitive symptom information to detect potential cases of coronaviruses early on, to track the clinical measures adopted by survivors, and to gather and examine appropriate data to verify the existence of the virus. There are five key components in the framework: symptom data collection and uploading (via communication technology), a quarantine/isolation center, an information processing core (using artificial intelligent techniques), cloud computing, and visualization to healthcare doctors. This research utilizes eight machine/deep learning techniques-Neural Network, Decision Table, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes, OneR, K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN), Dense Neural Network (DNN), and the Long Short-Term Memory technique-to detect coronavirus cases from time-sensitive information.

Since no effective vaccine is available, isolation techniques to prevent infection such as home quarantine and social distancing while in public have remained the cornerstone of public health interventions. While government and health officials were charged with implementing stay-at-home strategies, many of which had little guidance as to the consequences of how quickly to begin them. Moreover, as the local epidemic curves have been flattened, the same officials must wrestle with when to ease or cease such restrictions as to not impose economic turmoil. To evaluate the effects of quarantine strategies during the initial epidemic, an agent based modeling framework was created to take into account local spread based on geographic and population data with a corresponding interactive desktop and web-based application. Using the state of Massachusetts in the United States of America, we have illustrated the consequences of implementing quarantines at different time points after the initial seeding of the state with COVID-19 cases.

Therefore, the CDC recommends routine immunizations for children and adolescent populations against vaccine-preventable diseases e.g., tetanus, pertussis, diphtheria, etc. This current review sought to examine barriers to pediatric vaccine uptake behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also explored the implications for parental vaccine hesitancy/delay during an ongoing health crisis and proposed recommendations for increasing vaccine confidence and compliance. Our review determined that the receipt for vaccinations steadily improved in the last decade for both the United States and Tennessee. However, this incremental progress has been forestalled by the COVID-19 pandemic and other barriers i.e. parental vaccine hesitancy, social determinants of health (SDoH) inequalities, etc. which further exacerbate vaccination disparities. Moreover, non-compliance to routine vaccinations could cause an outbreak of diseases, thereby, worsening the ongoing health crisis and already strained health care system. Healthcare providers are uniquely positioned to offer effective recommendations with presumptive languaging to increase vaccination rates, as well as, address parental vaccine hesitancy. Best practices that incorporate healthcare providers' quality improvement coaching, vaccination reminder recall systems, adherence to standardized safety protocols (physical distancing, hand hygiene practices, etc.), as well as, offer telehealth and outdoor/drive-through/curbside vaccination services, etc. are warranted. Additionally, a concerted effort should be made to utilize public health surveillance systems to collect, analyze, and interpret data, thereby, ensuring the dissemination of timely, accurate health information for effective health policy decision-making e.g., vaccine distribution, etc.",,,,"Olusanya, Olufunto A./AAO-5779-2021; Shaban-Nejad, Arash/ABG-4110-2020","Olusanya, Olufunto A./0000-0001-6983-2882; Shaban-Nejad, Arash/0000-0003-2047-4759",,,,,,,,,,,,1664-3224,,,,,MAR 18,2021,12,,,,,,,,663074,10.3389/fimmu.2021.663074,,,,,,,WOS:000635546500001,33815424,,,,,,,,

This finding is reiterated by our transcriptional analysis of respiratory samples revealing the global response to infection. We describe a new method for lung histopathology scoring that will provide a metric to enable clearer decision making for this key endpoint. In contrast to prior publications, in which rhesus are accepted to be the preferred study species, we provide convincing evidence that both macaque species authentically represent mild to moderate forms of COVID-19 observed in the majority of the human population and both species should be used to evaluate the safety and efficacy of interventions against SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, accessing cynomolgus macaques will greatly alleviate the pressures on current rhesus stocks. Non-human primates are important animal models for studying SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Quantitative data were collected using an online survey (n = 1975) and face-to-face interviews (n = 2200) with a pre-tested structured questionnaire. In addition, seven open-ended interviews were conducted with health experts regarding challenges of vaccination. Binary logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess the association between explanatory and dependent variables. Effect size was estimated to understand the magnitude of relationship between two variables. Of 4175 respondents, 92.6% knew about COVID-19 vaccines, while only 37.4% believed vaccines to be effective in controlling COVID-19. Nearly 46% of respondents believed that COVID-19 vaccines have side-effects, and 16.4% of respondents believed that side-effects could be life-threatening. Only 60.5% of respondents indicated that they would receive the COVID-19 vaccine.

Smallpox, caused by Variola virus (VARV) infection, is highly transmissible and estimated to have killed 300 million people in the 20th century alone with ~30% mortality. Through an intensive vaccination campaign smallpox was declared eradicated in 1980 and routine smallpox vaccination of individuals ceased. Today's population has little/no immunity against VARV; if smallpox were to re-emerge the worldwide results would be devastating. Development of antiviral strategies is critical for outbreak response efforts and in order to truly gauge the potential effectiveness of a medical countermeasure (MCM), it must be tested directly against the pathogen. VARV is solely a human pathogen and infections of surrogate animal models have been largely unsuccessful. Here we use the humanized mouse to establish the first small animal model using VARV. We found that the virus spread systemically within humanized mice before mortality (~ 13 days post infection), similar to the time from exposure to symptom onset for ordinary human smallpox. These findings improve upon current MCM efficacy testing methods by providing a means to conduct in vivo evaluations of smallpox MCMs directly against VARV.</p> Smallpox, caused by the solely human pathogen Variola virus (VARV), was declared eradicated in 1980. While known VARV stocks are secure, smallpox remains a bioterrorist threat agent. Recent U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of the first smallpox anti-viral (tecovirimat) therapeutic was a successful step forward in smallpox preparedness; however, orthopoxviruses can become resistant to treatment, suggesting a multi-therapeutic approach is necessary. Animal models are required for testing medical countermeasures (MCMs) and ideally MCMs are tested directly against the pathogen of interest. Since VARV only infects humans, a representative animal model for testing therapeutics directly against VARV remains a challenge. Here we show that three different humanized mice strains are highly susceptible to VARV infection, establishing the first small animal model using VARV. In comparison, the non-humanized, immunosuppressed background mouse was not susceptible to systemic VARV infection. Following an intranasal VARV challenge that mimics the natural route for human smallpox transmission, the virus spread systemically within the humanized mouse before mortality (~ 13 days post infection), similar to the time from exposure to symptom onset for ordinary human smallpox. Our identification of a permissive/representative VARV animal model can facilitate testing of MCMs in a manner consistent with their intended use.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1553-7366,1553-7374,,,,SEP,2021,17,9,,,,,,,e1009633,10.1371/journal.ppat.1009633,,,,,,,WOS:000697689600002,34547055,,,,,,,,

The WHO named this coronavirus 2019-nCoV, with COVID-19 being the name for diseases allied with it. Objective . The study intended to examine the features and characteristics of existing human coronaviruses and identify their resemblance to the newly identified 2019-nCoV. Design . The research team performed a literature review, searching relevant literature databases. We searched four databases, PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and CNKI (Chinese Database), to identify studies reporting COVID-19. Articles published on or before April 10, 2020 were eligible for inclusion. We used the following search terms: Coronavirus or 2019-nCoV or COVID-19 or SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV or Bat SARS-CoV or ACE2 receptor. Setting . This study was take place in School of Pharmacy, Suresh Gyan Vihar University, Jaipur, India. Results . The undistinguishable similarity of the genomic sequences of Severe Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV, and Bat SARS-CoV-bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21-to nCoV-2019 has facilitated the process of identifying primary treatment measures. Researchers are presuming the existence of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor binding in nCoV-2019, as in SARS-CoV. Researchers have been examining human-to-human transmission, the possibility of an intermediate host between bats and humans, and the existence of asymptomatic cases. An incubation period of 0 to 14 days has been reported, with acute to chronic symptoms being cough, nasal congestion, high fever, dyspnea, pneumonia, invasive lesions in both lungs, respiratory failure, and even death, including in pediatric cases. Mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, repurposing of antivirals, and plasma infusion have proven to be somewhat effective. Several countries have started clinical trials to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of some drugs, but the ability to vaccinate people with existing or new molecules will require time. Previously learned lessons from SARS and MERS have led some areas to be well equipped in terms of the ability to take speedy action. Conclusions . First-level treatments include repurposing antivirals and antimalarials, and plasma infusion should help, but development of existing or new molecules into vaccines will take time.

Until herd immunity is achieved with vaccines, the only available mechanisms for controlling the pandemic are quarantines, perimeter closures and social distancing with the aim of reducing mobility. Governments only apply these measures for a reduced period, since they involve the closure of economic activities such as tourism, cultural activities, or nightlife. The main criterion for establishing these measures and planning socioeconomic subsidies is the evolution of infections. However, the collapse of the health system and the unpredictability of human behavior, among others, make it difficult to predict this evolution in the short to medium term. This article evaluates different models for the early prediction of the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic to create a decision support system for policy-makers. We consider a wide branch of models including artificial neural networks such as LSTM and GRU and statistically based models such as autoregressive (AR) or ARIMA.

A total of six disease-causing species have been identified in humans. Viral infections play a vital role in human diseases, and recent outbreaks have developed globally in the form of novel corona. The SS-RNA virus from the enveloped coronavirus family caused SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), a life-threatening viral infection. In many countries around the world, the spread of infection is rapid. As of March 26, 2020, there were 462.684 confirmed cases globally, and 20.834 deaths were recorded. The World Health Organization (WHO) described COVID-19 as a pandemic on March 11, 2020. There are numerous drug trials going on with some positive results. However, since no vaccine is available, the best way to combat the virus is to use preventive methods. Methods: In this study, an attempt was made to find the new COVID-19 main protease inhibitor with a molecular docking approach. A grid-based docking approach was chosen to find the binding using VLife MDS software. The 2D structure of the compounds was created and then converted into the 3D, and then, it was energetically minimized up to the RMS gradient of 0.01, using the Merck Molecular Force Field (MMFF). By using cavity determination option, the enzyme's cavities were determined. Cavity no.1 was selected for docking. The active site for docking was defined as all atoms within 5A degrees radius. Results: Hydroxychloroquine is a slow-acting antirheumatic drug. The value of hydroxychloroquine is analogous to that reported for other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs. The docking score obtained was -4.308880 and the number of receptor atoms was 77, while the number of ligand atoms was 20, which shows that hydroxychloroquine binds effectively with Covid-19 protease. Conclusion: Hydroxychloroquine was taken as drug following Lipinski's rule of five, so it had a very good drug score and drug-likeness score as well. This study reveals that Hydroxychloroquine has good binding affinity with COVID-19 protease and thus can be used as prophylaxis and therapeutic treatment for corona patients.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2587-196X,,,,,2020,4,3,,,,,219,226,,10.14744/ejmo.2020.91607,,,,,,,WOS:000604255600007,,,,,,,,,

RNA viruses exhibit an extraordinary ability to evolve in a changing environment and to switch from animal hosts to humans. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, recognized as a respiratory disease, is an example of zoonotic transmission of the RNA virus known as SARS-CoV-2. The development and regulatory approval of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 pose multiple preventive and therapeutic challenges, especially during an ongoing pandemic. Objective . The review intended to examine the challenges and recent achievements in the development of vaccine candidates against COVID-19. Design . The research team performed a literature review, searching relevant and up to date information from the literature. The sources of data included Google Scholar, PubMed, NCBI, and Yahoo. The search terms used were COVID-19 challenges, SARS-CoV-2 prospective challenges, RNA viruses adoptability, host switching by RNA viruses, COVID-19 vaccines. Setting . The study took place at the digital libraries of contributing institutions. The data was combined, selected for further analysis and manuscript preparation at King Abdulaziz University. Results . RNA viruses with high rate of genome alterations and evolution have better chances to survive in the adverse environmental conditions by adopting the alternate host species. The recent epidemics such as SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 are examples of zoonotic transmission of RNA viruses from animal species to the humans. However, the mechanisms involved in the switching-on to new host species need further investigations to control the zoonotic transmissions in near future. As of April 2020, 115 candidate vaccines were being evaluated; 78 of them had been found to be active, and a few of them are in Phase I trials. In the development of different types of vaccine candidates against COVID19, multiple international pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are involved. Conclusions . Emerging and re-emerging pathogenic RNA viruses pose a serious threat to human health. Little is known about the human-host adoptive mechanism for zoonotic transmission. Deep insights into the molecular mechanism responsible for the switching of animal or bird viruses to humans could provide target molecules or events to prevent such transmissions in the near future. Fast development and approval of efficacious and safe vaccines is key to the effort to provide preventive measures against COVID-19 and future viruses. However, the development and availability of a vaccine candidate is a time-consuming process and often can't be completed during an epidemic.

Etwa 2% aller Mitarbeiter verspurten uberhaupt keine Nebenwirkungen. Haufigste Nebenwirkung waren Schmerzen an der Injektionsstelle. In absteigender Haufigkeit folgten Mudigkeit, Kopfschmerzen und Myalgien. Nach der ersten Dosis gaben 3 Viertel der Befragten an, die Impfung insgesamt gut vertragen zu haben, nach der zweiten Dosis war es nur noch die Halfte. Nach der ersten Dosis fuhlten sich uber 90% der Befragten am Folgetag wieder arbeitsfahig, nach der zweiten Dosis gab ein Drittel an, erst am zweiten Tag wieder arbeitsfahig gewesen zu sein. 2,2% aller MitarbeiterInnen mussten sich nach der ersten, 19,5% nach der zweiten Dosis fur mindestens einen Tag arbeitsunfahig melden. Schlussfolgerung Die Impfung mit BNT162b2 fuhrte - insbesondere nach der zweiten Dosis - haufig zu Nebenwirkungen. Diese hatten in 19% der Befragten eine Krankmeldung nach der zweiten Dosis zur Folge. Dennoch wurden sich 95% aller Befragten wieder fur eine Coronavirus-Impfung entscheiden. Abstract Background Since December 27, 2020, employees of the health system in Germany have been vaccinated against the SARS coronavirus-2 with the vaccine BNT162B2. Initial observations show that especially among younger vaccinated people side effects are common. In this study, using the example of clinic employees, the self-perceived well-being after the first and second dose of the vaccine was examined. Methods Anonymized online questionnaire to be filled out once by all employees after the second dose of BNT162B2 was offered. The severity of side effects was queried using an ordinal numerical rating scale with values between 0 and 10. Other key data points were age, gender, and occupational group.The ability to work in the days following the injections was recorded by self-reporting. Results Data from 555 respondents were evaluated. The mean age was 40.25 years (standard deviation 12.35). 56% of the respondents were female, 44.3% belonged to the medical service, 42.9% to the nursing service and 12.8% were assigned to other professional groups with COVID-19 patient contact. Around 2% of all employees did not experience any side effects at all. The most common side effect was pain at the injection site. Fatigue, headaches and myalgia followed with decreasing frequency. After the first dose, of the respondents said they had tolerated the vaccination well overall, after the second dose it was only half. After the first dose, over 90% of the respondents felt that they were able to work again on the following day, after the second dose one third stated that they were only able to work again on the second day. 2.2% of all employees had to report that they were unable to work for at least one day after the first dose and 19.5% after the second dose. Conclusions Vaccination with BNT162B2 frequently leads to side effects, especially after the second dose. Perception of side effects resulted in 19% of those questioned being sick after the second dose. Nevertheless, 95% of all respondents would choose a coronavirus vaccination again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0012-0472,1439-4413,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1055/a-1520-2127,,JUL 2021,,,,,WOS:000672051300001,34243217,,,,,,,,
J,"Baker, TL; Greiner, JV",,,,"Baker, Terrance L.; Greiner, Jack V.",,,Guidelines for Reopening a Nation in a SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic: A Path Forward,MEDICINA-LITHUANIA,,,,,,,,,,,,"Background and Objectives: Action, not fear, is the path forward in the coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Since early 2020, the world's nations have faced conundrums over severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections resulting in COVID-19 resulting in national closures, and thus, a clear understandable plan that nations can implement is required to reopen. The healthcare benefits of reopening a nation more likely than not exceed the benefits of continued pandemic-related closure. Pandemic-related closures have resulted in countless delayed or avoided urgent care evaluations. Furthermore, routine care of acute and chronic illnesses, including evaluations, diagnoses, and treatments, has also been delayed. Isolation, loss of income, and fear have resulted in mental health conditions or exacerbated existing conditions. The magnitude of untoward ramifications is unknown and may ultimately represent an inestimable degree of danger and morbidity, and even death. The pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 has created an atmosphere of fear of COVID-19 that has directly and indirectly injured the world's population. Since this has resulted in increasing morbidity and mortality, creating economic chaos, and near systemic collapse of educational systems with no well described plan forward, it is the purpose of this study to provide guidelines that provide a path forward to safely open a nation. Physicians often equipped by their education, training, and experiences across disciplines are uniquely positioned to comprehend, coordinate, and teach other physicians, business owners, and municipal and government leaders from guidelines. As such, physicians may take the lead in a path forward to reopening a nation, including opening businesses, educational facilities, and religious establishments, while minimizing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Materials and Methods: Reviews of the literature among the disciplines of environmental air, sanitation, social interaction, medical testing, vaccination, protection, and disease prevention and safety allowed for the conceptualization and eventual genesis of identifiable interventions which either reduce the viral load in the environment or inactivate the virus from replication. Each of the guidelines was selected based on the principle that it involved the elimination or inactivation of the viral particle. With a reduction in viral load or inactivation of replication, the implementation of these guidelines is expected to allow for reopening a nation with an increased level of safety. Results: The guidelines identified, including air exchange (ventilation), air filtration, personal protective filtering devices (masks), hand hygiene, social distancing, screening and testing, vaccines, high-risk patient protection, medical management, and adjunctive therapies, are described and referenced. Conclusions: In that the pandemic is primarily a public health issue, the path forward is best coordinated by local, regional, and national physicians. Many physicians with a breadth of experiences are uniquely positioned to coordinate the implementation of these interdisciplinary guidelines. Using these guidelines as a planned, coordinated action, not fear, is a path forward. Nations have a decision to make: closuring versus opening.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1010-660X,1648-9144,,,,MAY,2021,57,5,,,,,,,496,10.3390/medicina57050496,,,,,,,WOS:000654336600001,34068853,,,,,,,,

We therefore aimed to assess the effects of vaccine characteristics, information on herd immunity, and general practitioner (GP) recommendation on vaccine hesitancy in a representative working-age population in France. Methods In this survey experiment, adults aged 18-64 years residing in France, with no history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, were randomly selected from an online survey research panel in July, 2020, stratified by gender, age, education, household size, and region and area of residence to be representative of the French population. Participants completed an online questionnaire on their background and vaccination behaviour-related variables (including past vaccine compliance, risk factors for severe COVID-19, and COVID-19 perceptions and experience), and were then randomly assigned according to a full factorial design to one of three groups to receive differing information on herd immunity (>50% of adults aged 18-64 years must be immunised [either by vaccination or infection]; >50% of adults must be immunised [either by vaccination or infection]; or no information on herd immunity) and to one of two groups regarding GP recommendation of vaccination (GP recommends vaccination or expresses no opinion). Participants then completed a series of eight discrete choice tasks designed to assess vaccine acceptance or refusal based on hypothetical vaccine characteristics (efficacy [50%, 80%, 90%, or 100%], risk of serious side-effects [1 in 10 000 or 1 in 100 000], location of manufacture [EU, USA, or China], and place of administration [GP practice, local pharmacy, or mass vaccination centre]). Responses were analysed with a two-part model to disentangle outright vaccine refusal (irrespective of vaccine characteristics, defined as opting for no vaccination in all eight tasks) from vaccine hesitancy (acceptance depending on vaccine characteristics). Findings Survey responses were collected from 1942 working-age adults, of whom 560 (28.8%) opted for no vaccination in all eight tasks (outright vaccine refusal) and 1382 (71.2%) did not. In our model, outright vaccine refusal and vaccine hesitancy were both significantly associated with female gender, age (with an inverted U-shaped relationship), lower educational level, poor compliance with recommended vaccinations in the past, and no report of specified chronic conditions (ie, no hypertension [ for vaccine hesitancy] or no chronic conditions other than hypertension [ for outright vaccine refusal]). Outright vaccine refusal was also associated with a lower perceived severity of COVID-19, whereas vaccine hesitancy was lower when herd immunity benefits were communicated and in working versus non-working individuals, and those with experience of COVID-19 (had symptoms or knew someone with COVID-19). For a mass vaccination campaign involving mass vaccination centres and communication of herd immunity benefits, our model predicted outright vaccine refusal in 29.4% (95% CI 28.6-30.2) of the French working-age population. Predicted hesitancy was highest for vaccines manufactured in China with 50% efficacy and a 1 in 10 000 risk of serious side-effects (vaccine acceptance 27.4% [26.8-28.0]), and lowest for a vaccine manufactured in the EU with 90% efficacy and a 1 in 100 000 risk of serious side-effects (vaccine acceptance 61.3% [60.5-62.1]). Interpretation COVID-19 vaccine acceptance depends on the characteristics of new vaccines and the national vaccination strategy, among various other factors, in the working-age population in France.

Trial design: The study is designed as a multicenter, open-label, blinded outcome assessment, parallel group, investigator-initiated, exploratory, randomized (1:1 ratio) controlled clinical trial. Participants: Asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 patients will be enrolled in 10 university and teaching hospitals in Japan. The inclusion and exclusion criteria are as follows: Inclusion criteria: (1) Japanese male or female patients aged >= 20 years (2) SARS-CoV-2 detected from a respiratory tract specimen (e.g., nasopharyngeal swab or saliva) using PCR, LAMP, or an antigen test within 3 days before obtaining the informed consent (3) Provide informed consent Exclusion criteria: (1) Symptoms developed >= 8 days prior to enrolment (2) SpO(2) < 96 % (room air) (3) Any of the following screening criteria: a) ALT or AST >= 5 x upper limit of the reference range b) Child-Pugh class B or C c) Serum creatinine >= 2 x upper limit of the reference range and creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min (4) Poorly controlled diabetes (random blood glucose >= 200 mg/dL or HbA1c >= 7.0%, despite treatment) (5) Unsuitable serious complications based on the assessment of either the principal investigator or the sub-investigator (6) Hemophiliac or patients with a marked hemorrhagic tendency (7) Severe diarrhea (8) Hypersensitivity to the investigational drug (9) Breastfeeding or pregnancy (10) With childbearing potential and rejecting contraceptive methods during the study period from the initial administration of the investigational drug (11) Receiving rifampicin within the previous 2 weeks (12) Participated in other clinical trials and received drugs within the previous 12 weeks (13) Undergoing treatment for HIV infection (14) History of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination or wishes to be vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 (15) Deemed inappropriate (for miscellaneous reasons) based on the assessment of either the principal investigator or the sub-investigator Intervention and comparator: Patients who meet the inclusion criteria and do not meet any of the exclusion criteria will be randomized to either the nelfinavir group or the symptomatic treatment group. The nelfinavir group will be administered 750 mg of nelfinavir orally, three times daily for 14 days (treatment period). However, if a participant tests negative on two consecutive PCR tests of saliva samples, administration of the investigational drug for that participant can be discontinued at the discretion of the investigators. The symptomatic treatment group will not be administered the investigational drug, but all other study procedures and conditions will be the same for both groups for the duration of the treatment period. After the treatment period of 14 days, each group will be followed up for 14 days (observational period). Main outcomes: The primary endpoint is the time to negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2. During the study period from Day 1 to Day 28, two consecutive negative PCR results of saliva samples will be considered as the negative conversion of the virus. The secondary efficacy endpoints are as follows: For patients with both asymptomatic and mild disease: area under the curve of viral load, half decay period of viral load, body temperature at each time point, all-cause mortality, incidence rate of pneumonia, percentage of patients with newly developed pneumonia, rate of oxygen administration, and the percentage of patients who require oxygen administration. For asymptomatic patients: incidence of symptomatic COVID-19, incidence of fever (>= 37.0 degrees C for two consecutive days), incidence of cough For patients with mild disease: incidence of defervescence (< 37.0 degrees C), incidence of recovery from clinical symptoms, incidence of improvement of each symptom The secondary safety endpoints are adverse events and clinical examinations. Randomization: Patients will be randomized to either the nelfinavir group or the symptomatic treatment group using the electric data capture system (1:1 ratio, dynamic allocation based on severity [asymptomatic], and age [< 60 years]). Blinding (masking) Only the assessors of the primary outcome will be blinded (blinded outcome assessment). Numbers to be randomized (sample size) The sample size was determined based on our power analysis to reject the null hypothesis, S (t | z =1) = S (t | z = 0) where S is a survival function, t is time to negative conversion, and z denotes randomization group, by the log-rank test with a two-sided p value of 0.05. We estimated viral dynamic parameters by fitting a nonlinear mixed-effects model to reported viral load data, and simulated our primary endpoint from viral-load time-courses that were realized from sets of viral dynamics parameters sampled from the estimated probability distribution of the parameters (sample size: 2000; 1000 each for randomization group). From this estimation of the hazard ratio between the randomization groups for the event of negative conversion using this simulation dataset, the required number of events for rejecting our null hypothesis with a power of 0.80 felled 97.345 by plugging the estimated hazard ratio, 1.79, in Freedman's equation. Therefore, we decided the required number of randomizations to be 120 after consideration of the frequency of censoring and the anticipated rate of withdrawal caused by factors such as withdrawal of consent.

This newly recognized virus is highly transmissible, and no clinically approved vaccine or antiviral medicine is currently available. Early diagnosis of infected patients through effective screening is needed to control the rapid spread of this virus. Chest radiography imaging is an effective diagnosis tool for COVID-19 virus and followup. Here, a novel hybrid multimodal deep learning system for identifying COVID-19 virus in chest X-ray (CX-R) images is developed and termed as the COVID-DeepNet system to aid expert radiologists in rapid and accurate image interpretation. First, Contrast-Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) and Butterworth bandpass filter were applied to enhance the contrast and eliminate the noise in CX-R images, respectively. Results from two different deep learning approaches based on the incorporation of a deep belief network and a convolutional deep belief network trained from scratch using a large-scale dataset were then fused. Parallel architecture, which provides radiologists a high degree of confidence to distinguish healthy and COVID-19 infected people, was considered. The proposed COVID-DeepNet system can correctly and accurately diagnose patients with COVID-19 with a detection accuracy rate of 99.93%, sensitivity of 99.90%, specificity of 100%, precision of 100%, F1-score of 99.93%, MSE of 0.021%, and RMSE of 0.016% in a large-scale dataset.

We explore logistical challenges related to U.S. OPV administration in 2020, review the literature related to nonspecific effects of OPV to induce innate immunity, and model the health and economic implications of the proposal. The costs of reintroducing a single OPV dose to 331 million Americans would exceed $4.4 billion. Giving a dose of bivalent OPV to the entire U.S. population would lead to an expected 40 identifiable cases of vaccine-associated paralytic polio, with young Americans at the highest risk. Reintroducing any OPV use in the U.S. poses a risk of restarting transmission of OPV-related viruses and could lead to new infections in immunocompromised individuals with B-cell related primary immunodeficiencies that could lead to later cases of paralysis. Due to the lack of a currently licensed OPV in the U.S., the decision to administer OPV to Americans for nonspecific immunological effects would require purchasing limited global OPV supplies that could impact polio eradication efforts. Health economic modeling suggests no role for reintroducing OPV into the U.S. with respect to responding to COVID-19. Countries that currently use OPV experience fundamentally different risks, costs, and benefits than the U.S. Successful global polio eradication will depend on sufficient OPV supplies, achieving and maintaining high OPV coverage in OPV-using countries, and effective global OPV cessation and containment in all countries, including the U.S.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0272-4332,1539-6924,,,,FEB,2021,41,2,,,SI,,376,386,,10.1111/risa.13614,,OCT 2020,,,,,WOS:000579720200001,33084153,,,,,,,,

The GRADE evidence-to-decision (EtD) framework was used to develop a recommendation for the use of the 4 COVID-19 vaccines approved in Canada as of March 25, 2021 (BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, ChAdOx1, and Ad26.COV2.S), over 4 virtual panel meetings. Results. The CRA guideline panel suggests using COVID-19 vaccination in persons with ARD. The panel unanimously agreed that for the majority of patients, the potential health benefits of vaccination outweigh the potential harms in people with ARDs. The recommendation was graded as conditional because of low or very low certainty of the evidence on the effects in the population of interest, primarily due to indirectness and imprecise effect estimates. The panel felt strongly that persons with autoimmune rheumatic diseases who meet local eligibility should not be required to take additional steps compared to people without ARDs to obtain their vaccination. Guidance on medications, implementation, monitoring of vaccine uptake, and research priorities are also provided. Conclusion. This recommendation will be updated over time as new evidence emerges, with the latest recommendation, evidence summaries, and EtD available on the CRA website.",,,,,"Barnabe, Cheryl/0000-0003-3761-237X; Zhou, Alan Liang/0000-0002-7525-5660; Mertz, Dominik/0000-0003-4337-1613; Barber, Claire/0000-0002-3062-5488",,,,,,,,,,,,0315-162X,1499-2752,,,,AUG 1,2021,48,8,,,,,1330,1339,,10.3899/jrheum.210288,,,,,,,WOS:000680558500021,33993119,,,,,,,,

We formulated recommendations to meet the urgent need for a consensus for vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in PRD. Methods Systematic literature reviews were performed to evaluate: (a) outcomes in PRD with COVID-19; (b) efficacy, immunogenicity and safety of COVID-19 vaccination; and (c) published guidelines/recommendations for non-live, non-COVID-19 vaccinations in PRD. Recommendations were formulated based on the evidence and expert opinion according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology. Results The consensus comprises 2 overarching principles and 7 recommendations. Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in PRD should be aligned with prevailing national policy and should be individualized through shared decision between the healthcare provider and patient. We strongly recommend that eligible PRD and household contacts be vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. We conditionally recommended that the COVID-19 vaccine be administered during quiescent disease if possible. Immunomodulatory drugs, other than rituximab, can be continued alongside vaccination. We conditionally recommend that the COVID-19 vaccine be administered prior to commencing rituximab if possible. For patients on rituximab, the vaccine should be administered a minimum of 6 months after the last dose and/or 4 weeks prior to the next dose of rituximab. Post-vaccination antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 need not be measured. Any of the approved COVID-19 vaccines may be used, with no particular preference.

Social media has been an important support for people while passing through this difficult period. On November 9, 2020, when the first vaccine with more than 90% effective rate has been announced, the social media has reacted and people worldwide have started to express their feelings related to the vaccination, which was no longer a hypothesis but closer, each day, to become a reality. The present paper aims to analyze the dynamics of the opinions regarding COVID-19 vaccination by considering the one-month period following the first vaccine announcement, until the first vaccination took place in UK, in which the civil society has manifested a higher interest regarding the vaccination process. Classical machine learning and deep learning algorithms have been compared to select the best performing classifier. 2 349 659 tweets have been collected, analyzed, and put in connection with the events reported by the media. Based on the analysis, it can be observed that most of the tweets have a neutral stance, while the number of in favor tweets overpasses the number of against tweets. As for the news, it has been observed that the occurrence of tweets follows the trend of the events. Even more, the proposed approach can be used for a longer monitoring campaign that can help the governments to create appropriate means of communication and to evaluate them in order to provide clear and adequate information to the general public, which could increase the public trust in a vaccination campaign.",,,,"Delcea, Camelia/C-4343-2011; Cotfas, Liviu-Adrian/D-2317-2009","Delcea, Camelia/0000-0003-3589-1969; Cotfas, Liviu-Adrian/0000-0002-4192-183X",,,,,,,,,,,,2169-3536,,,,,,2021,9,,,,,,33203,33223,,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3059821,,,,,,,WOS:000633627200001,,,,,,,,,

Global regulators have highlighted the key role of HCPs in fostering confidence in COVID-19 vaccines. Objective This study aims to gain insight into the views and experiences of HCPs on providing vaccines information to patients. Setting Primary care general practice surgeries and community pharmacies in Ireland. Methods Qualitative, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 14 HCPs (five General practitioners [GPs], four practice nurses and five community pharmacists) identified through purposive and convenience sampling. The interviews were analysed by inductive thematic analysis. Main outcome measure Participants' views and experiences of providing vaccines information to patients. Results Five key themes were identified: roles and responsibilities, perception of risk, perception of the public, building a relationship, and emotion. HCPs were motivated by duty and care for their patients. They respected patient autonomy and were driven by their concern for public health. HCPs were influenced by their perception of risk and their perceptions of the public. HCPs practiced patient-centred care by providing tailored vaccines information. They favoured an approach of providing patients with information and support to make their own decision. The topic was emotive; HCPs empathised with patients but were also frustrated by their perceived inability to change some patients' views. Conclusion The provision of vaccines information by HCPs to patients is multifactorial with participants mindful of patient autonomy and the HCP role to support vaccinations as a public health priority.

We aimed to evaluate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 re-infections in the general population in Austria. Methods This is a retrospective observational study using national SARS-CoV-2 infection data from the Austrian epidemiological reporting system. As the primary outcome, we aim to compare the odds of SARS-CoV-2 re-infections of COVID-19 survivors of the first wave (February to April 30, 2020) versus the odds of first infections in the remainder general population by tracking polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed infections of both groups during the second wave from September 1 to November 30, 2020. Re-infection counts are tentative, since it cannot be excluded that the positive PCR in the first and/or second wave might have been a false positive. Results We recorded 40 tentative re-infections in 14 840 COVID-19 survivors of the first wave (0.27%) and 253 581 infections in 8 885 640 individuals of the remaining general population (2.85%) translating into an odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of 0.09 (0.07 to 0.13). Conclusions We observed a relatively low re-infection rate of SARS-CoV-2 in Austria.

Our two research questions are (1) what are the users' experience and satisfaction levels with the three apps? and (2) what are the main issues (problems) that users have reported about the apps? Methods We assess the popularity of the apps and end users' perceptions based on user reviews in app stores. We conduct three types of analysis (data mining, sentiment analysis and topic modelling) to derive insights from the combined set of 25 583 user reviews of the aforementioned three apps (submitted by users until the end of 2020). Results Results show that end users have been generally dissatisfied with the apps under study, except the Scottish app. Some of the major issues that users have reported are high battery drainage and doubts on whether apps are really working. Discussion Towards the end of 2020, the much-awaited COVID-19 vaccines started to be available, but still, analysing the users' feedback and technical issues of these apps, in retrospective, is valuable to learn the right lessons to be ready for similar circumstances in future. Conclusion Our results show that more work is needed by the stakeholders behind the apps (eg, apps' software engineering teams, public-health experts and decision makers) to improve the software quality and, as a result, the public adoption of these apps. For example, they should be designed to be as simple as possible to operate (need for usability).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2632-1009,,,,,2021,28,1,,,,,,,e100320,10.1136/bmjhci-2021-100320,,,,,,,WOS:000688055900001,34281994,,,,,,,,

The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has further exacerbated this problem and demonstrated the critical need for the 21st century approach. This approach needs to ingest relevant, diverse data sources, analyze them, and generate appropriate health intelligence products that enable users to take more effective and efficient actions for their specific challenges. Objectives This article characterizes the Health Intelligence Atlas (HI-Atlas) development and implementation to produce Public Health Intelligence (PHI) that supports identifying and prioritizing high-risk communities by public health authorities. The HI-Atlas moves from post hoc observations to a proactive model-based approach for preplanning COVID-19 vaccine preparedness, distribution, and assessing the effectiveness of those plans. Results Details are presented on how the HI-Atlas merged traditional surveillance data with social intelligence multidimensional data streams to produce the next level of health intelligence. Two-model use cases in a large county demonstrate how the HI-Atlas produced relevant PHI to inform public health decision makers to (1) support identification and prioritization of vulnerable communities at risk for COVID-19 spread and vaccine hesitancy, and (2) support the implementation of a generic model for planning equitable COVID-19 vaccine preparedness and distribution.

Methods The Brazilian COVID-19 vaccination plan was evaluated and the hindrances to make the COVID-19 vaccination plan efficient were described and discussed. Results High territorial extension might contribute to a delay on the COVID-19 vaccination, due to difficulty in delivering vaccines to furthest Brazilian states and to all the interior cities. The choice among the vaccines should be done based on the type of storage and must consider the transport conditions necessary to maintain its effectiveness. The indigenous individuals were included with health-care workers as the first group to be vaccinated, inflaming the number of vaccines doses distributed in states where the indigenous population have higher prevalence. The antivaccine movement and the politicization of the vaccine are also hindrances to be overcome in Brazil. The COVID-19 incidence or mortality rate and the distribution of intensive care units (ICUs) are not a criterion to distribute the vaccines, as we did not identify a correlation between these markers and the number of vaccines. However, a strong or very strong correlation occurred between the number of COVID-19 vaccines and the number of COVID-19 cases, deaths by COVID-19, gross domestic product, as well as populational density. A total of 83,280,475 doses of COVID-19 vaccines were distributed in Brazil. In the first dose, the Coronavac (Sinovac (TM)), AZD1222 (AstraZeneca/Oxford (TM)), and BNT162b (Pfizer/BioNTech (TM)) vaccines were responsible to vaccinate, respectively, 9.61%, 6.69%, and 0.35% of the Brazilian population.

The study was registered with ISRCTN, ISRCTN37254291. Summary Background The effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccination programme depends on mass participation: the greater the number of people vaccinated, the less risk to the population. Concise, persuasive messaging is crucial, particularly given substantial levels of vaccine hesitancy in the UK. Our aim was to test which types of written information about COVID-19 vaccination, in addition to a statement of efficacy and safety, might increase vaccine acceptance. Methods For this single-blind, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial, we aimed to recruit 15 000 adults in the UK, who were quota sampled to be representative. Participants were randomly assigned equally across ten information conditions stratified by level of vaccine acceptance (willing, doubtful, or strongly hesitant).

The study was registered with ISRCTN, ISRCTN37254291. Findings From Jan 19 to Feb 5, 2021, 15 014 adults were recruited. Vaccine hesitancy had reduced from 26 & middot;9% the previous year to 16 & middot;9%, so recruitment was extended to Feb 18 to recruit 3841 additional vaccine-hesitant adults. 12 463 (66 & middot;1%) participants were classified as willing, 2932 (15 & middot;6%) as doubtful, and 3460 (18 & middot;4%) as strongly hesitant (ie, report that they will avoid being vaccinated for as long as possible or will never get vaccinated). Information conditions did not alter COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in those willing or doubtful (adjusted p values >0 & middot;70). In those strongly hesitant, COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was reduced, in comparison to the control condition, by personal benefit information (mean difference -1 & middot;49, 95% CI -2 & middot;16 to -0 & middot;82; adjusted p=0 & middot;0015), directly addressing safety concerns about speed of development (-0 & middot;91, -1 & middot;58 to -0 & middot;23; adjusted p=0 & middot;0261), and a combination of all information (-0 & middot;86, -1 & middot;53 to -0 & middot;18; adjusted p=0 & middot;0313). In those strongly hesitant, provision of personal benefit information reduced hesitancy to a greater extent than provision of information on the collective benefit of not personally getting ill (-0 & middot;97, 95% CI -1 & middot;64 to -0 & middot;30; adjusted p=0 & middot;0165) or the collective benefit of not transmitting the virus (-1 & middot;01, -1 & middot;68 to -0 & middot;35; adjusted p=0 & middot;0150). Ethnicity and gender were found to moderate information condition outcomes. Interpretation In the approximately 10% of the population who are strongly hesitant about COVID-19 vaccines, provision of information on personal benefit reduces hesitancy to a greater extent than information on collective benefits. Where perception of risk from vaccines is most salient, decision making becomes centred on the personal. As such, messaging that stresses the counterbalancing personal benefits is likely to prove most effective. The messaging from this study could be used in public health communications. Going forwards, the study highlights the need for future health campaigns to engage with the public on the terrain that is most salient to them.

Additional safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines are needed in a timely manner to adequately address the pandemic on an international scale. Such safe and effective vaccines would be especially appealing for international deployment if they also have favorable stability, supply, and potential for implementation in mass vaccination campaigns. Randomized trials provide particularly reliable insights about vaccine efficacy and safety. While enhanced efficiency and interpretability can be obtained from placebo-controlled trials, in settings where their conduct is no longer possible, randomized non-inferiority trials may enable obtaining reliable evaluations of experimental vaccines through direct comparison with active comparator vaccines established to have worthwhile efficacy. Methods: The usual objective of non-inferiority trials is to reliably assess whether the efficacy of an experimental vaccine is not unacceptably worse than that of an active control vaccine previously established to be effective, likely in a placebo-controlled trial. This is formally achieved by ruling out a non-inferiority margin identified to be the minimum threshold for what would constitute an unacceptable loss of efficacy. This article not only investigates non-inferiority margins, denoted by delta, that address the usual objective of determining whether the experimental vaccine is at least similarly effective to the active comparator vaccine in the non-inferiority trial, but also develops non-inferiority margins, denoted by delta(o), intended to address the worldwide need for multiple safe and effective vaccines by satisfying the less stringent requirement that the experimental vaccine be at least similarly effective to an active comparator vaccine having efficacy that satisfies the widely accepted World Health Organization-Food and Drug Administration criteria for worthwhile vaccine efficacy. Results: Using the margin delta enables non-inferiority trials to reliably evaluate experimental vaccines that truly are similarly effective to an active comparator vaccine having any level of worthwhile efficacy. When active comparator vaccines have efficacy in the range of 50%-70%, non-inferiority trials designed to use the margin delta(o) have appealing properties, especially for experimental vaccines having true efficacy of approximately 60%. Conclusion: Non-inferiority trials using the proposed margins may enable reliable randomized evaluations of efficacy and safety of experimental COVID-19 vaccines. Such trials often require approximately two- to three-fold the person-years follow-up than a placebo-controlled trial. This could be achieved, without substantive increases in sample size, by increasing the average duration of follow-up from 2 months to approximately 4-6 months, assuming efficacy of the active comparator vaccine has been reliably evaluated over that longer duration.",,,,,"Nason, Martha/0000-0002-0110-881X",,,,,,,,,,,,1740-7745,1740-7753,,,,JUN,2021,18,3,,,,,335,342,1.74077E+15,10.1177/1740774520988244,,FEB 2021,,,,,WOS:000621142200001,33535811,,,,,,,,

An objective and quantitative means of passively monitoring the impact and response of these interventions at a local level is needed. Objective: We aim to explore the utility of the recently developed open-source mobile health platform Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse (RADAR)-base as a toolbox to rapidly test the effect and response to NPIs intended to limit the spread of COVID -19. Methods: We analyzed data extracted from smartphone and wearable devices, and managed by the RADAR-base from 1062 participants recruited in Italy, Spain, Denmark, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. We derived nine features on a daily basis including time spent at home, maximum distance travelled from home, the maximum number of Bluetooth-enabled nearby devices (as a proxy for physical distancing), step count, average heart rate, sleep duration, bedtime, phone unlock duration, and social app use duration. We performed Kruskal-Wallis tests followed by post hoc Dunn tests to assess differences in these features among baseline, prelockdown, and during lockdown periods. We also studied behavioral differences by age, gender, BMI, and educational background. Results: We were able to quantify expected changes in time spent at home, distance travelled, and the number of nearby Bluetooth-enabled devices between prelockdown and during lockdown periods (P<.001 for all five countries). We saw reduced sociality as measured through mobility features and increased virtual sociality through phone use. People were more active on their phones (P<.001 for Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom), spending more time using social media apps (P<.001 for Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands), particularly around major news events. Furthermore, participants had a lower heart rate (P<.001 for Italy and Spain; P=.02 for Denmark), went to bed later (P<.001 for Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands), and slept more (P<.001 for Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom). We also found that young people had longer homestay than older people during the lockdown and fewer daily steps. Although there was no significant difference between the high and low BMI groups in time spent at home, the low BMI group walked more. Conclusions: RADAR-base, a freely deployable data collection platform leveraging data from wearables and mobile technologies, can be used to rapidly quantify and provide a holistic view of behavioral changes in response to public health interventions as a result of infectious outbreaks such as COVID-19. RADAR-base may be a viable approach to implementing an early warning system for passively assessing the local compliance to interventions in epidemics and pandemics, and could help countries ease out of lockdown.",,,,"Lamers, Femke/G-5161-2012; Zabalza, Ana/AAX-5767-2020; Matcham, Faith/AAW-8550-2021; Costa, Gloria Dalla/F-6440-2017; dobson, richard/C-9269-2011; Penninx, Brenda WJH/S-7627-2017","Zabalza, Ana/0000-0003-3860-5251; Costa, Gloria Dalla/0000-0002-8761-9337; dobson, richard/0000-0003-4224-9245; Stewart, Callum/0000-0001-9947-8677; , Ana Isabel/0000-0001-5891-2123; Matcham, Faith/0000-0002-4055-904X; Folarin, Amos/0000-0002-0333-1927; Conde, Pauline/0000-0003-0513-0915; Rashid, Zulqarnain/0000-0002-6843-9920; Penninx, Brenda WJH/0000-0001-7779-9672; Myin-Germeys, Inez/0000-0002-3731-4930; Ranjan, Yatharth/0000-0003-3079-3120",,,,,,,,,,,,1438-8871,,,,,SEP 25,2020,22,9,,,,,,,e19992,10.2196/19992,,,,,,,WOS:000599327200008,32877352,,,,,,,,

It is the hope that vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 will deliver a comprehensive solution to this global pandemic; however, this will require extensive national vaccination programs. Ultimately, clinical conditions and even sudden unexplained death will occur around the time of vaccination, thus a distinction needs to be made between events that are causally related to the vaccine or temporally related to vaccination. This study aimed to estimate the background occurrence of 43 clinical conditions in the Japanese population. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted from 2013 to 2019 using data from two large healthcare claims databases (MDV and JMDC) in Japan. The estimated number of new cases and incidence were calculated based on the actual number of new cases identified in the databases. The PubMed and Ichushi-web databases, as well as grey literature such as guidelines and government statistics, were also searched to identify any publications related to incidence of these conditions in Japan. Results and conclusion The estimates of the number of total cases and incidence were similar for the MDV and JMDC databases for some diseases. In addition, some estimates were similar to those in the scientific literature. For example, from the MDV and JMDC databases, estimates of incidence of confirmed Bell's palsy in 2019 were 41.7 and 47.9 cases per 100,000 population per year, respectively. These estimates were of the same order from the scientific publication. Determining whether clinical conditions occurring around the time of vaccination are causally or only temporally related to vaccination will be critical for public health decision makers as well as for the general public. Comparison of background occurrence at the population level may provide some additional objective evidence for the evaluation of temporality or causality.",,,,,"Ito, Shuhei/0000-0003-0289-7766",,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,AUG 26,2021,16,8,,,,,,,e0256379,10.1371/journal.pone.0256379,,,,,,,WOS:000697186000047,34437567,,,,,,,,

Online multilingual survey consisting of 23 items, between 17 May -15 July of 2019 targeting the opinions and practices of ICTs regarding the 2018-2019 influenza season was employed. Participants were reached via European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) and European Union Certificate for Infection Control (EUCIC) newsletters, social media, and national societies. In total, 899 participants from 56 countries responded to the survey. The overall vaccination rate was 76%, being the highest in Finland, Portugal, Norway, and Israel (100%), whereas the lowest in Italy (68%) and Turkey (39%). Influenza vaccination rate was 86% among IC physicians and 52% among IC nurses. The most significant factors affecting participants' decision were personal influenza vaccine experience (49%) and attitude of the scientific authorities (48%). In multivariate analysis, vaccination of the ICT head (OR: 16.04, 95%CI: 8.4-30.8, p < 0.001) and having free vaccine (OR: 7.56, 95%CI: 2.1-27.4, p = 0.02) were found to be the strongest predictors for influenza vaccination, whereas working in Turkey (OR: 0.41, 95%CI: 0.22-0.77, p = 0.006) and being an IC nurse (OR:0.43, 95%CI: 0.24-0.80, p = 0.007) were significantly associated with not having been vaccinated. In conclusion, COVID-19 pandemic increased the importance of protection against respiratory viruses including influenza. Vaccination strategies should have a special emphasis on IC nurses, who have a relatively lower vaccination rate, should enhance the vaccination of the ICT leaders, and put effort to provide free availability of the influenza vaccine.

In an unprecedented collective effort, massive amounts of data are now being collected worldwide to estimate the immediate and long-term impact of this pandemic on the health system and the global economy. However, the precise timeline of the disease, its transmissibility, and the effect of mitigation strategies remain incompletely understood. Here we integrate a global network model with a local epidemic SEIR model to quantify the outbreak dynamics of COVID-19 in China and the United States. For the outbreak in China, in n=30 provinces, we found a latent period of 2.56 +/- 0.72 days, a contact period of 1.47 +/- 0.32 days, and an infectious period of 17.82 +/- 2.95 days. We postulate that the latent and infectious periods are disease-specific, whereas the contact period is behavior-specific and can vary between different provinces, states, or countries. For the early stages of the outbreak in the United States, in n=50 states, we adopted the disease-specific values from China and found a contact period of 3.38 +/- 0.69 days. Our network model predicts that-without the massive political mitigation strategies that are in place today-the United States would have faced a basic reproduction number of 5.30 +/- 0.95 and a nationwide peak of the outbreak on May 10, 2020 with 3 million infections. Our results demonstrate how mathematical modeling can help estimate outbreak dynamics and provide decision guidelines for successful outbreak control. We anticipate that our model will become a valuable tool to estimate the potential of vaccination and quantify the effect of relaxing political measures including total lockdown, shelter in place, and travel restrictions for low-risk subgroups of the population or for the population as a whole.",,,,"Costabal, Francisco Sahli/X-8791-2019; Kuhl, Ellen/G-4444-2011","Costabal, Francisco Sahli/0000-0002-2612-463X; Kuhl, Ellen/0000-0002-6283-935X; Peirlinck, Mathias/0000-0002-4948-5585",,,,,,,,,,,,1617-7959,1617-7940,,,,DEC,2020,19,6,,,,,2179,2193,,10.1007/s10237-020-01332-5,,APR 2020,,,,,WOS:000529117800001,32342242,,,,,,,,

Due to the lack of immediately available vaccines and effective drugs, many policy- and decision-makers have focused on non-pharmacological methods, including social distancing. This study was aimed at assessing the effects of the implementation of this policy in Iran, one of the countries most affected by COVID-19. We conducted a quasi-experimental study, utilizing the interrupted time series analysis (ITSA) approach. Methods: We collected daily data between February 20, 2020 and January 29, 2021, through governmental websites from 954 public hospitals and healthcare settings. The Iranian government launched the social distancing policy on March 27, 2020. Statistical analyses, including ITSA, were carried out with R software Version 3.6.1 (London, UK). Results: During the study period, 1,398,835 confirmed incidence cases and 57,734 deaths occurred. We found a decrease of -179.93 (95% CI: -380.11 to -20.25, P-value=0.078) confirmed incidence cases following the implementation of the social distancing policy, corresponding to a daily decrease in the trend of -31.17 (95% CI: -46.95 to -15.40, P-value=0.08).

Results 7554 HCWs participated, 2.2% of whom tested positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Multivariate analysis revealed increased COVID-19 risk for nurses (3.1% seropositivity, 95% CI 2.5-3.9%, p = 0.012), staff working on COVID-19 units (4.6% seropositivity, 95% CI 3.2-6.5%, p = 0.032), males (2.4% seropositivity, 95% CI 1.8-3.2%, p = 0.019), and HCWs reporting high-risk exposures to infected patients (5.5% seropositivity, 95% CI 4.0-7.5%, p = 0.0022) or outside of work (12.0% seropositivity, 95% CI 8.0-17.4%, p < 0.0001).

When the COVID-19 outbreak began to spread, there was no vaccination and no treatment. To epidemic diseases without vaccines or other pharmaceutical intervention, the only way to control them is a sustained physical distancing. In this work, we propose a simple control law to keep the epidemic outbreak controlled. A sustained physical distancing level is adjusted to guarantee the fastest way to finish the outbreak with the number of hospitalized individuals below the desired value. This technique can reduce the economic problems of social distancing and keeps the health care system working. The proposed controller is a closed-loop approach that uses the number of hospitalized individuals as the feedback signal. It also does not need massive swab tests, which simplify the application of the technique. We do stability analyses of the proposed controller to prove the robustness to uncertainties in the parameters and unmodeled dynamics. We present a version of the proposed controller to operate using steps to reopen, which is relevant to help the decision-makers. The proposed controller is so simple that we can use a spreadsheet to calculate the physical distancing level. In the end, we present a set of numerical simulations to highlight the behavior of the number of hospitalized individuals during an epidemic disease when using the proposed control law. We simulate the proposed controller applied to the ideal case, considering uncertainties, unmodeled dynamics, a 10 days latent period, and different values of the desired number of hospitalized individuals.

Here we describe efforts to collect attitudinal and behavioural data and disseminate insights to increase situational awareness and inform interventions. Methods We developed a rapid data collection and monitoring system based on a cross-national online survey, the COVID-19 Health Behavior Survey. Respondent recruitment occurred via targeted Facebook advertisements in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. We investigated how the threat perceptions of COVID-19, the confidence in the preparedness of organisations to deal with the pandemic, and the adoption of preventive and social distancing behaviours are associated with respondents' demographic characteristics. Results We analysed 71,612 questionnaires collected between March 13-April 19, 2020. We found substantial spatio-temporal heterogeneity across countries at different stages of the pandemic and with different control strategies in place. Respondents rapidly adopted the use of face masks when they were not yet mandatory. We observed a clear pattern in threat perceptions, sharply increasing from a personal level to national and global levels. Although personal threat perceptions were comparatively low, all respondents significantly increased hand hygiene. We found gender-specific patterns: women showed higher threat perceptions, lower confidence in the healthcare system, and were more likely to adopt preventive behaviours. Finally, we also found that older people perceived higher threat to themselves, while all respondents were strongly concerned about their family. Conclusions Rapid population surveys conducted via Facebook allow us to monitor behavioural changes, adoption of protective measures, and compliance with recommended practices. As the pandemic progresses and new waves of infections are a threatening reality, timely insights from behavioural and attitudinal data are crucial to guide the decision-making process.",,,,,"Perrotta, Daniela/0000-0003-3014-8551",,,,,,,,,,,,,2193-1127,,,,APR 14,2021,10,1,,,,,,,17,10.1140/epjds/s13688-021-00270-1,,,,,,,WOS:000639846400001,33880320,,,,,,,,

The fast spread of the etiologic agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), highlights the need to identify unknown coronaviruses rapidly for prompt clinical and public health decision making. Moreover, owing to the high mutation rate of RNA viruses, periodic surveillance on emerging variants of key virus components is essential for evaluating the efficacy of antiviral drugs, diagnostic assays and vaccines. These 2 knowledge gaps formed the basis of this study. In the first place, we evaluated the feasibility of characterizing coronaviruses directly from respiratory specimens. We amplified partial RdRP gene, a stable genetic marker of coronaviruses, from a collection of 57 clinical specimens positive for SARS-CoV-2 or other human coronaviruses, and sequenced the amplicons with Nanopore Flongle and MinION, the fastest and the most scalable massively-parallel sequencing platforms to-date. Partial RdRP sequences were successfully amplified and sequenced from 82.46% (47/57) of specimens, ranging from 75 to 100% by virus type, with consensus accuracy of 100% compared with Sanger sequences available (n=40). In the second part, we further compared 19 SARS-CoV-2 RdRP sequences collected from the first to third waves of COVID-19 outbreak in Hong Kong with 22,173 genomes from GISAID EpiCoV (TM) database. No single nucleotide variants (SNVs) were found in our sequences, and 125 SNVs were observed from global data, with 56.8% being low-frequency (n=1-47) missense mutations affecting the rear part of RNA polymerase. Among the 9 SNVs found on 4 conserved domains, the frequency of 15438G>T was highest (n=34) and was predominantly found in Europe. Our data provided a glimpse into the sequence diversity of a primary antiviral drug and diagnostic target. Further studies are warranted to investigate the significance of these mutations.",,,,"Poon, Leo/AAP-6887-2020",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1743-422X,,,,NOV 23,2020,17,1,,,,,,,183,10.1186/s12985-020-01454-3,,,,,,,WOS:000595833600001,33225958,,,,,,,,

Methods: Using open data repository with daily infected, recovered and death cases in the period between March 2020 and April 2021, a descriptive analysis was performed. The susceptible-exposed-infected-recovery model was used to estimate the effective productive number (Rt). The duration taken from Rt > 1 to R t < 1 and case load were first modelled by using the compound Poisson method. Machine learning analysis using the K-means clustering method was further adopted to classify patterns of community-acquired outbreaks worldwide. Results: The global estimated Rt declined after the first surge of COVID-19 pandemic but there were still two major surges of epidemics occurring in September 2020 and March 2021, respectively, and numerous episodes due to various extents of Nonpharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs). Unsupervised machine learning identified five patterns as controlled epidemic, mutant propagated epidemic, propagated epidemic, persistent epidemic and long persistent epidemic with the corresponding duration and the logarithm of case load from the lowest (18.6 +/- 11.7; 3.4 +/- 1.8)) to the highest (258.2 +/- 31.9; 11.9 +/- 2.4). Countries like Taiwan outside five clusters were classified as no community-acquired outbreak. Conclusion: Data-driven models for the new classification of community-acquired outbreaks are useful for global surveillance of uninterrupted COVID-19 pandemic and provide a timely decision support for the distribution of vaccine and the optimal NPIs from global to local community.

So far, there are no effective therapeutic drugs or vaccines for COVID-19. The most serious complication of COVID-19 is a type of pneumonia called 2019 novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (NCIP) with about 4.3% mortality rate. Comparing to chest Digital Radiography (DR), it is recently reported that chest Computed Tomography (CT) is more useful to serve as the early screening and diagnosis tool for NCIP. In this study, aimed to help physicians make the diagnostic decision, we develop a machine learning (ML) approach for automated diagnosis of NCIP on chest CT. Different from most ML approaches which often require training on thousands or millions of samples, we design a few-shot learning approach, in which we combine few-shot learning with weakly supervised model training, for computerized NCIP diagnosis. A total of 824 patients are retrospectively collected from two Hospitals with IRB approval. We first use 9 patients with clinically confirmed NCIP and 20 patients without known lung diseases for training a location detector which is a multitask deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) designed to output a probability of NCIP and the segmentation of targeted lesion area. An experienced radiologist manually localizes the potential locations of NCIPs on chest CTs of 9 COVID-19 patients and interactively segments the area of the NCIP lesions as the reference standard. Then, the multitask DCNN is furtherly fine-tuned by a weakly supervised learning scheme with 291 case-level labeled samples without lesion labels. A test set of 293 patients is independently collected for evaluation. With our NCIP-Net, the test AUC is 0.91.

Despite multiple case-series, actionable knowledge to tailor decision-making proactively is missing. RESEARCH QUESTION: Can a statistical model accurately predict infection with COVID-19? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We developed a prospective registry of all patients tested for COVID-19 in Cleveland Clinic to create individualized risk prediction models. We focus here on the likelihood of a positive nasal or oropharyngeal COVID-19 test. A least absolute shrinkage and selection operator logistic regression algorithm was constructed that removed variables that were not contributing to the model's cross-validated concordance index. After external validation in a temporally and geographically distinct cohort, the statistical prediction model was illustrated as a nomogram and deployed in an online risk calculator. RESULT In the development cohort, 11,672 patients fulfilled study criteria, including 818 patients (7.0%) who tested positive for COVID-19; in the validation cohort, 2295 patients fulfilled criteria, including 290 patients who tested positive for COVID-19. Male, African American, older patients, and those with known COVID-19 exposure were at higher risk of being positive for COVID-19. Risk was reduced in those who had pneumococcal polysaccharide or influenza vaccine or who were on melatonin, paroxetine, or carvedilol. Our model had favorable discrimination (c-statistic = 0.863 in the development cohort and 0.840 in the validation cohort) and calibration.

As the COVID-19 crisis endures and the virus continues to spread globally, the need for collecting epidemiological data and patient information also grows exponentially. The race against the clock to find a cure and a vaccine to the disease means researchers require storage of increasingly large and diverse types of information; for doctors following patients, recording symptoms and reactions to treatments, the need for storage flexibility is only surpassed by the necessity of storage security. The volume, variety, and variability of COVID-19 patient data requires storage in NoSQL database management systems (DBMSs). But with a multitude of existing NoSQL DBMSs, there is no straightforward way for institutions to select the most appropriate. And more importantly, they suffer from security flaws that would render them inappropriate for the storage of confidential patient data. Motivation. This paper develops an innovative solution to remedy the aforementioned shortcomings. COVID-19 patients, as well as medical professionals, could be subjected to privacy-related risks, from abuse of their data to community bullying regarding their medical condition. Thus, in addition to being appropriately stored and analyzed, their data must imperatively be highly protected against misuse. Methods. This paper begins by explaining the five most popular categories of NoSQL databases. It also introduces the most popular NoSQL DBMS types related to each one of them. Moreover, this paper presents a comparative study of the different types of NoSQL DBMS, according to their strengths and weaknesses. This paper then introduces an algorithm that would assist hospitals, and medical and scientific authorities to choose the most appropriate type for storing patients' information. This paper subsequently presents a set of functions, based on web services, offering a set of endpoints that include authentication, authorization, auditing, and encryption of information. These functions are powerful and effective, making them appropriate to store all the sensitive data related to patients. Results and Contributions. This paper presents an algorithm to select the most convenient NoSQL DBMS for COVID-19 patients, medical staff, and organizations data. In addition, the paper proposes innovative security solutions that eliminate the barriers to utilizing NoSQL DBMSs to store patients' data. The proposed solutions resolve several security problems including authentication, authorization, auditing, and encryption. After implementing these security solutions, the use of NoSQL DBMSs will become a much more appropriate, safer, and affordable solution to storing and analyzing patients' data, which would contribute greatly to the medical and research effort against COVID-19. This solution can be implemented for all types of NoSQL DBMSs; implementing it would result in highly securing patients' data, and protecting them from any downsides related to data leakage.",,,,,"Elhabshy, Abd Allah/0000-0002-5258-6109",,,,,,,,,,,,2376-5992,,,,,SEP 10,2020,,,,,,,,,e297,10.7717/peerj-cs.297,,,,,,,WOS:000569840900001,33816948,,,,,,,,

Although nonpharmaceutical interventions were implemented by federal and state governments in the United States, these efforts have failed to contain the virus. Following the Food and Drug Administration's approval of two COVID-19 vaccines, however, the hope for the return to normalcy has been renewed. This hope rests on an unprecedented nationwide vaccine campaign, which faces many logistical challenges and is also contingent on several factors whose values are currently unknown. Objective: We study the effectiveness of a nationwide vaccine campaign in response to different vaccine efficacies, the willingness of the population to be vaccinated, and the daily vaccine capacity under two different federal plans. To characterize the possible outcomes most accurately, we also account for the interactions between nonpharmaceutical interventions and vaccines through 6 scenarios that capture a range of possible impacts from nonpharmaceutical interventions. Methods: We used large-scale, cloud-based, agent-based simulations by implementing the vaccination campaign using COVASIM, an open-source agent-based model for COVID-19 that has been used in several peer-reviewed studies and accounts for individual heterogeneity and a multiplicity of contact networks. Several modifications to the parameters and simulation logic were made to better align the model with current evidence. We chose 6 nonpharmaceutical intervention scenarios and applied the vaccination intervention following both the plan proposed by Operation Warp Speed (former Trump administration) and the plan of one million vaccines per day, proposed by the Biden administration. We accounted for unknowns in vaccine efficacies and levels of population compliance by varying both parameters. For each experiment, the cumulative infection growth was fitted to a logistic growth model, and the carrying capacities and the growth rates were recorded. Results: For both vaccination plans and all nonpharmaceutical intervention scenarios, the presence of the vaccine intervention considerably lowers the total number of infections when life returns to normal, even when the population compliance to vaccines is as low as 20%. We noted an unintended consequence; given the vaccine availability estimates under both federal plans and the focus on vaccinating individuals by age categories, a significant reduction in nonpharmaceutical interventions results in a counterintuitive situation in which higher vaccine compliance then leads to more total infections. Conclusions: Although potent, vaccines alone cannot effectively end the pandemic given the current availability estimates and the adopted vaccination strategy. Nonpharmaceutical interventions need to continue and be enforced to ensure high compliance so that the rate of immunity established by vaccination outpaces that induced by infections.",,,,,"Giabbanelli, Philippe/0000-0001-6816-355X",,,,,,,,,,,,,2291-9694,,,,APR,2021,9,4,,,,,,,e27419,10.2196/27419,,,,,,,WOS:000646051700025,33872188,,,,,,,,

The disruption in return caused weak resilience of CSC activities. Unfortunately, the existing models for managing CSC focus on preparedness and recovery while neglecting the visibility perspective of resilience CSC. Towards creating a resilience CSC, this study modelled construction 4.0 as the vaccine for supply chain resilience in the construction industry. Design/methodology/approach A survey questionnaire was used to collect data randomly from construction stakeholders. The questionnaire was analysed with a structural equation model analysis using SmartPLS while conducting tests such as path coefficient analysis, discriminant analysis and importance-performance analysis. Findings This study discovered that construction 4.0 is a significant tool and vaccine for ensuring visibility, recovery and adaptation within the supply chain. Construction 4.0 will function as a vaccine for ensuring resilience because of its capacity to optimise CSC management by introducing an evidence-based management approach and less dependent on implicit knowledge. Towards reaping the full potential of construction 4.0, it should be adopted as a moderating variable. Research limitations/implications The research is limited by the use of a single methodology (quantitative) without including a qualitative method to understand better and explore the impact of construction 4.0 on CSC resilience. The qualitative part can be carried out by conducting interviews targeted at construction stakeholders. Practical implications In spite of the limitations, the findings of this study contributed to building a more responsive and resilient CSC during the pandemic period. Furthermore, this study also presented the crucial construction 4.0 technology capable of ensuring resilience within the CSC. Originality/value This paper presents a model for applying construction 4.0 as a vaccine for ensuring CSC resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic period.

Social isolation (lockdown) has been assessed to prevent and control virus diffusion, leading to a worldwide financial and political crisis. Currently, SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in nasopharyngeal swab takes place by real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). However, molecular tests can give some false-negative results. In this context, serological assays can be useful to detect IgG/IgM antibodies, to assess the degree of immunization, to trace the contacts, and to support the decision to re-admit people at work. A lot of serological diagnostic kits have been proposed on the market but validation studies have not been published for many of them. The aim of our work was to compare and to evaluate different assays analytical performances (two different immunochromatographic cards, an immunofluorescence chromatographic card, and a chemiluminescence-automated immunoassay) on 43 positive samples with RT-qPCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and 40 negative control subjects. Our data display excellent IgG/IgM specificities for all the immunocromatographic card tests (100% IgG and 100% IgM) and for the chemiluminescence-automated assay (100% IgG and 94% IgM); IgG/IgM sensitivities are moderately lower for all methods, probably due to the assay viral antigen's nature and/or to the detection time of nasopharyngeal swab RT-qPCR, with respect to symptoms onset. Given that sensitivities (around 94% and 84% for IgG and IgM, respectively) implicate false-negative cases and given the lack of effective vaccines or treatments, the only currently available procedure to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission is to identify and isolate persons who are contagious. For this reason, we would like to submit a flowchart in which serological tests, integrated with nasopharyngeal swab RT-qPCR, are included to help social and work activities implementation after the pandemic acute phase and to overcome lockdown.",,,,"Pieri, Massimo/ABE-7686-2020","Pieri, Massimo/0000-0002-3463-0268",,,,,,,,,,,,,2058-7716,,,,MAY 26,2020,6,1,,,,,,,38,10.1038/s41420-020-0275-2,,,,,,,WOS:000537758200003,,,,,,,,,

Forecasting the trend of COVID-19 infections could help in executing policies to effectively reduce the number of new cases. In this study, we apply the decomposition and ensemble model to forecast COVID-19 confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries in Pakistan for the upcoming month until the end of July. For the decomposition of data, the Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) technique is applied. EEMD decomposes the data into small components, called Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs). For individual IMFs modelling, we use the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. The data used in this study is obtained from the official website of Pakistan that is publicly available and designated for COVID-19 outbreak with daily updates. Our analyses reveal that the number of recoveries, new cases, and deaths are increasing in Pakistan exponentially. Based on the selected EEMD-ARIMA model, the new confirmed cases are expected to rise from 213,470 to 311,454 by 31 July 2020, which is an increase of almost 1.46 times with a 95% prediction interval of 246,529 to 376,379. The 95% prediction interval for recovery is 162,414 to 224,579, with an increase of almost two times in total from 100802 to 193495 by 31 July 2020. On the other hand, the deaths are expected to increase from 4395 to 6751, which is almost 1.54 times, with a 95% prediction interval of 5617 to 7885. Thus, the COVID-19 forecasting results of Pakistan are alarming for the next month until 31 July 2020. They also confirm that the EEMD-ARIMA model is useful for the short-term forecasting of COVID-19, and that it is capable of keeping track of the real COVID-19 data in nearly all scenarios.

Observing the failures of several COVID-19 forecasting models and the alarming spread of the virus, we seek to use some stable response for forecasting COVID-19, viz., ratios of COVID-19 cases to mortalities, rather than COVID-19 cases or fatalities. A trend of low COVID-19 cases-to-mortality ratios calls for urgent attention: the need for vaccines, for instance. Studies have shown that there are influences of weather parameters on COVID-19; and COVID-19 may have come to stay and could manifest a seasonal outbreak profile similar to other infectious respiratory diseases. In this paper, the influences of some weather, geographical, economic and demographic covariates were evaluated on COVID-19 response based on a series of Granger-causality tests. The effect of four weather parameters, viz., temperature, rainfall, solar irradiation and relative humidity, on daily COVID-19 cases-to-mortality ratios of 36 countries from 5 continents of the world were determined through regression analysis. Regression studies show that these four weather factors impact ratios of COVID-19 cases-to-mortality differently. The most impactful factor is temperature which is positively correlated with COVID-19 cases-to-mortality responses in 24 out of 36 countries. Temperature minimally affects COVID-19 cases-to-mortality ratios in the tropical countries. The most influential weather factor - temperature - was incorporated in training random forest and deep learning models for forecasting the cases-to-mortality rate of COVID-19 in clusters of countries in the world with similar weather conditions. Evaluation of trained forecasting models incorporating temperature features show better performance compared to a similar set of models trained without temperature features. This implies that COVID-19 forecasting models will predict more accurately if temperature features are factored in, especially for temperate countries. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

These plans' implementation was part of the usual logic of post-marketing surveillance of new and innovative health products. It was especially adapted to the context of post-marketing monitoring of drugs developed according to the usual scientific quality standards but in an accelerated schedule. In Europe, the reinforced surveillance system relies on the complementary strengths of pharmacovigilance and pharmacoepidemiology. If the performances of pharmacovigilance monitoring are incomparable for the detection of safety signals relating to rare events of atypical presentation, it needs to be completed with pharmacoepidemiology activities for more common events, either multifactorial or frequently classified as idiopathic. The pharmacoepidemiological monitoring developed in Europe was elaborated before the first SARS-Cov-2 vaccines where marketed, taking into account the lessons learned from the vaccination campaign against 2009 A (H1N1) influenza. It includes numerous academic studies as well as studies performed within vaccines risk management plans. In terms of safety, those defined a priori mostly concerns a list of pre-established health events of specific interest. Aside of these planned activities, ad-hoc studies will be latter developed on purpose to investigate safety signals or potential signals that could be identified as the result of pharmacovigilance activities. Aside of these regulated activities, as for today, very few studies have been published regarding SARS-Cov-2 vaccines; most of the existing consist in preprints that should be considered with caution. Pharmacoepidemiology of vaccines is thought to allow near-real time monitoring that needs sufficient time to provide with valid results. In the constant urge for information that accompanies COVID-related science, it is important not to make haste the enemy of speed and to let pharmacoepidemiology provides with what it is expected to do: rock-solid scientific information contributing to evidence-based decision-making.

OBJECTIVE To explore the experiences of Black and Latinx communities during the pandemic to better understand their perspectives on COVID-19 mitigation behaviors (eg, mask wearing), testing, and vaccines. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this community-engaged qualitative study conducted with 18 community-based organizations and 4 health care organizations between November 19, 2020, and February 5, 2021, in New Jersey counties severely affected by the pandemic, group and individual interviews were used to purposively sample 111 Black and Latinx individuals. A total of 13 group interviews were organized by race/ethnicity and language: 4 English-speaking groups with Black participants (n = 34), 3 Spanish-speaking groups with Latinx participants (n = 24), and 4 English-speaking groups with Black and Latinx participants (n = 36). To understand the views of health care workers from these communities, 2 additional groups (n = 9) were convened and supplemented with individual interviews. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Description of Black and Latinx participants' experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic and their perspectives on mitigation behaviors, testing, and vaccines. RESULTS The study included 111 participants (87 women [78.4%]; median age, 43 years [range, 18-93 years]). Participants described the devastating effects of the pandemic on themselves, loved ones, and their community. Their experiences were marked by fear, illness, loss, and separation. These experiences motivated intense information seeking, mitigation behaviors, and testing. Nevertheless, vaccine skepticism was high across all groups. Participants did not trust the vaccine development process and wanted clearer information. Black participants expressed that they did not want to be subjects of experiments. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The remaining unknowns about new vaccines need to be acknowledged and described for Black and Latinx communities to make informed decisions. Ultimately, scientists and public officials need to work transparently to address unanswered questions and work collaboratively with trusted community leaders and health professionals to foster partnered approaches, rather than focusing on marketing campaigns, to eliminate vaccine skepticism.",,,,,"Crabtree, Benjamin/0000-0003-2292-6835; Hudson, Shawna/0000-0002-7026-0743",,,,,,,,,,,,2574-3805,,,,,JUL 15,2021,4,7,,,,,,,e2117074,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.17074,,,,,,,WOS:000672992700004,34264327,,,,,,,,

With the rapid spread of this pandemic, vaccination has been a breakthrough solution. At the time of conducting the study, COVID-19 vaccines were only approved for adults 18 years and older. Therefore, the aim of the study was to assess the parents' likelihood of vaccinating their children once the recommendation for pediatric vaccination is established. Methods This was a cross-sectional study in which a self-administered survey was distributed to all parents visiting National Guard primary healthcare centers in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The questionnaires were distributed to parents attending primary care clinics. Data collected in the questionnaire include demographics (gender, marital status, educational level, and age), questions assessing parental perception towards the COVID-19 vaccine, and willingness to offer the vaccine to their children. Results A total of 333 respondents completed the survey with a response rate of 83.3%. Half of the participants were males and the other half were females with the majority (45.6%) aged between 31 and 40 years old. In terms of parental acceptability of vaccinating their children against COVID-19, 53.7% of the parents were willing to vaccinate their children as opposed to 27% who were reluctant to do so. Of those who refused, 97.5% and 96.6% cited lack of information and evidence, respectively, as the most common reasons for not accepting COVID-19 vaccine. We have found that age of the parents, especially those 31-40 years old, age of their children, especially 4-12 years old, and previous acceptance of the seasonal influenza vaccine were significantly associated with higher parental acceptability of COVID-19 vaccine. In contrast, gender, marital status and educational level were not statistically significant factors. Conclusion As COVID-19 spread globally and made people's lives in danger, vaccination became a highly important measure to halt the spread of the disease. Parents are now given the choice of protecting their beloved children from COVID-19 infection and its possible complications. Based on our findings, we noticed that majority of parents are going to vaccinate their children. In addition, some certain age groups of parents and children were significantly associated with decreased vaccine hesitancy to take the COVID-19 vaccine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2168-8184,,,,SEP 28,2021,13,9,,,,,,,e18342,10.7759/cureus.18342,,,,,,,WOS:000705079600002,34646710,,,,,,,,

A Framework for Assisting Healthcare Organisations in Transitioning to a Zero-Trust Network Architecture,APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL,,,,,,,,,,,,"Traditional networks are designed to be hard on the outside and soft on the inside. It is this soft inside which has made the traditional perimeter model laughable to attackers, who can easily breach a network and run away with the data without even having to deal with the hardened perimeter. The zero-trust security model, created by John Kindervag in 2010, addresses the security flaws of the traditional perimeter model and asserts that all network traffic on the inside should not be trusted by default. Other core principles of zero trust include verification and continuous monitoring of all communication, as well as encryption of all data in transit and data at rest, since the goal of zero trust is to focus on protecting data. Although the zero-trust model was created in 2010, with some of the associated security practices existing even before that, many healthcare organisations are still choosing to focus primarily on securing the perimeter instead of focusing on the vulnerabilities within them. The current COVID-19 pandemic which healthcare providers are struggling with further highlights the need for improvements to security within the network perimeter, as many healthcare providers and vaccine developers are still using vulnerable, outdated legacy systems which could become compromised and indirectly have a detrimental effect on patient care. Legacy systems which are technologically limited, as well as medical devices which cannot be controlled or managed by network administrators, create boundaries to transitioning to a zero-trust architecture. It is challenges like this that have been explored during the research phase of this project in order to gain a better understanding of how a health organisation can adopt zero-trust practices despite the limitations of their current architecture. From the information gathered during this research, a framework was developed to allow a health organisation to transition to a more secure architecture based on the concept of zero-trust. Aspects of the proposed framework were tested in Cisco Modelling Labs (CML), and the results were evaluated to ensure the validity of some of the recommendations laid out in the framework. The main objective of this research was to prove that if a host within the local area network (LAN) were to be compromised, the damage would be limited to that host and would not spread throughout the rest of the network. This was successful after the qualitative research performed in CML. One of the other takeaways from testing the framework in CML was that medical devices could be secured by placing firewalls directly in front of them. This placement of firewalls may seem like an unorthodox approach and was shown to increase latency, but the blocking of all unnecessary traffic on the rest of the network will result in a performance boost and should balance it out in a real-world application.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2076-3417,,,,AUG,2021,11,16,,,,,,,7499,10.3390/app11167499,,,,,,,WOS:000688731100001,,,,,,,,,

Against this backdrop, this current study sets to assess the vaccine-taking intention, ways to overcome the vaccine-taking reluctance among Bangladeshi people and explore their knowledge, perceptions, and attitude toward the COVID-19 vaccine. To this end, this study leveraged on a cross-sectional survey, which was consisted of 1377 respondents covering the eight divisions of Bangladesh. The descriptive statistical method and ordinal logistics regression were employed to explore and rationalize our study outlined objectives. Empirical findings revealed that approximately 71% of the respondents had adequate knowledge about the COVID-19 vaccine, whereas 46% of the respondents were willing to be vaccinated against COVID-19 while the rest of the respondents were hesitant to take the vaccine. However, concern about the potential side effects was one of the core reasons for vaccine-taking hesitancy. Assuring the common people about vaccine safety and efficacy, along with easing the registration procedure, can ameliorate people's confidence to get vaccinated. Meanwhile, about 60% of the respondents believed that a vaccine could help Bangladesh win the battle against COVID-19 and will allow back to normal life. Although the government has taken some pragmatic action steps to promote the vaccination rate, it is recommended that the mass vaccination program should be extended to the grassroots level with proper extension community support and easing the registration process.",,,,"Rana, Jaber/AAS-8173-2021","Rana, Jaber/0000-0002-1656-7592",,,,,,,,,,,,2164-5515,2164-554X,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1080/21645515.2021.1968215,,SEP 2021,,,,,WOS:000698739600001,34554050,,,,,,,,

Therefore, this scoping review was performed to determine the prevalence of intention to use COVID-19 vaccines among adults aged 18-60, and to identify the demographic, social, and contextual factors that influence the intention to use COVID-19 vaccines. Methods: This scoping review was conducted by using the methodological framework for scoping review outlined by Arksey and O'Malley. A search strategy was carried out on four electronic databases: PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, and PsycINFO. All peer-reviewed articles published between November 2019 and December 2020 were reviewed. Data were extracted to identify the prevalence of, and factors that influence, the intention to use COVID-19 vaccines. Results: A total of 48 relevant articles were identified for inclusion in the review. Outcomes presented fell into seven themes: demographics, social factors, vaccination beliefs and attitudes, vaccine-related perceptions, health-related perceptions, perceived barriers, and vaccine recommendations. Age, gender, education level, race/ethnicity, vaccine safety and effectiveness, influenza vaccination history, and self-protection from COVID-19 were the most prominent factors associated with intention to use COVID-19 vaccines. Furthermore, the majority of studies (n = 34/48) reported a relatively high prevalence of intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19, with a range from 60% to 93%. Conclusion: This scoping review enables the creation of demographic, social, and contextual constructs associated with intention to vaccinate among the adult population. These factors are likely to play a major role in any targeted vaccination programs, particularly COVID-19 vaccination. Thus, our review suggests focusing on the development of strategies to promote the intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19 and to overcome vaccine hesitancy and refusal.

Until now, the COVID-19 vaccine is the most promising measure to subdue contagion and achieve herd immunity. However, public vaccination intention is suboptimal. A clear division lies between medical professionals and laypeople. While most professionals eagerly promote the vaccination campaign, some laypeople exude suspicion, hesitancy, and even opposition toward COVID-19 vaccines. Objective: This study aims to employ a text mining approach to examine expression differences and thematic disparities between the professionals and laypeople within the COVID-19 vaccine context. Methods: We collected 3196 answers under 65 filtered questions concerning the COVID-19 vaccine from the China-based question and answer forum Zhihu. The questions were classified into 5 categories depending on their contents and description: adverse reactions, vaccination, vaccine effectiveness, social implications of vaccine, and vaccine development. Respondents were also manually coded into two groups: professional and laypeople. Automated text analysis was performed to calculate fundamental expression characteristics of the 2 groups, including answer length, attitude distribution, and high-frequency words. Furthermore, structural topic modeling (STM), as a cutting-edge branch in the topic modeling family, was used to extract topics under each question category, and thematic disparities were evaluated between the 2 groups. Results: Laypeople are more prevailing in the COVID-19 vaccine-related discussion. Regarding differences in expression characteristics, the professionals posted longer answers and showed a conservative stance toward vaccine effectiveness than did laypeople. Laypeople mentioned countries more frequently, while professionals were inclined to raise medical jargon. STM discloses prominent topics under each question category. Statistical analysis revealed that laypeople preferred the safety of Chinese-made vaccine topic and other vaccine-related issues in other countries. However, the professionals paid more attention to medical principles and professional standards underlying the COVID-19 vaccine. With respect to topics associated with the social implications of vaccines, the 2 groups showed no significant difference. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that laypeople and professionals share some common grounds but also hold divergent focuses toward the COVID-19 vaccine issue. These incongruities can be summarized as qualitatively different in perspective rather than quantitatively different in scientific knowledge. Among those questions closely associated with medical expertise, the qualitatively different characteristic is quite conspicuous. This study boosts the current understanding of how the public perceives the COVID-19 vaccine, in a more nuanced way. Web-based question and answer forums are a bonanza for examining perception discrepancies among various identities. STM further exhibits unique strengths over the traditional topic modeling method in statistically testing the topic preference of diverse groups. Public health practitioners should be keenly aware of the cognitive differences between professionals and laypeople, and pay special attention to the topics with significant inconsistency across groups to build consensus and promote vaccination effectively.",,,,,"Tang, Yulong/0000-0001-8243-6323; Luo, Chen/0000-0002-9736-0533",,,,,,,,,,,,1438-8871,,,,,AUG 27,2021,23,8,,,,,,,e30715,10.2196/30715,,,,,,,WOS:000689731600017,34346885,,,,,,,,

However, vaccination rates have become politically polarized, and a substantial proportion of Republicans have remained vaccine hesitant for months. Here, we explore how endorsements by party elites affect Republicans' COVID-19 vaccination intentions and attitudes. In a preregistered survey experiment (n = 1,480), we varied whether self-identified Republicans saw endorsements of the vaccine from prominent Republicans (including video of a speech by former President Donald Trump), from the Democratic Party (including video of a speech by President Joseph Biden), or a neutral control condition including no endorsements. Unvaccinated Republicans who were exposed to the Republican elite endorsement reported 7.0% higher vaccination intentions than those who viewed the Democratic elite endorsement and 5.7% higher than those in the neutral control condition. These effects were statistically mediated by participants' reports of how much they thought Republican politicians would want them to get vaccinated. We also found evidence of backlash effects against Democratic elites: Republicans who viewed the Democratic elite endorsement reported they would be significantly less likely to encourage others to vaccinate and had more negative attitudes toward the vaccine, compared with those who viewed the Republican elite endorsement or the neutral control. These results demonstrate the relative advantage of cues from Republican elites-and the risks of messaging from Democrats currently in power-for promoting vaccination among the largest vaccine-hesitant subgroup in the United States.",,,,,"Chu, James Y./0000-0003-2702-470X",,,,,,,,,,,,0027-8424,,,,,AUG 10,2021,118,32,,,,,,,e2106559118,10.1073/pnas.2106559118,,,,,,,WOS:000685043800016,34312254,,,,,,,,

Second, we expect a positive relationship between prosocial values and vaccination intentions. Third, we hypothesize that beliefs in justification by authority moderate the relationship between prosocial values and vaccination intentions, so that the positive correlation between prosocial values and vaccination intentions becomes stronger with increasing beliefs in justification by authority. Hypotheses were tested in a sample of N = 314 German university students, a group with rather high mobility, who, when vaccinated, will increase the chance of attaining herd immunity. Hypotheses were tested using correlational and multiple regression analyses. Results revealed a highly significant positive relationship between justification by authority and vaccination intentions, whereas both hypotheses that included prosocial values did not yield significant results. Additional exploratory analyses revealed that the relationship between justification by authority and vaccination intentions was mediated by beliefs in the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines. Furthermore, significant negative relationships were found between personal justification and vaccination intentions as well as between justification by multiple sources and vaccination intentions.

Methods: An analytical cross-sectional study was performed via anonymous Qualtrics survey administered to approximately 4500 faculty, staff, postdoctoral research associates/medical residents, and employees at a multi-campus health sciences university in the United States. Respondents were asked demographic questions and intention to receive the vaccine. Factors associated with the intention to receive a vaccine were determined using logistic regression analysis. Results: A total sample of 2258 subjects were evaluated (50.0% response rate). Among all respondents, 64.6% reported that they would probably or definitely receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Men had higher levels of intention to receive the vaccine (OR= 2.11, 95% CI 1.64-2.71); respondents who indicated yearly influenza vaccines are necessary were also more likely to receive the vaccine (OR = 6.04, 95% CI 4.70-7.75).

Medical conspiracy beliefs, scientific skepticism, as well as low trust in governmental institutions, and evidence-based knowledge all have troubling effects on immunization. Objective: To examine how these factors cross-react to influence vaccine behavior against any vaccine preventable disease (VPD), we hypothesized a model consisting of the belief in conspiracy theories as the predictor, and as the mediators subjective and objective vaccine knowledge, and trust in the health care system and science. The model was tested by examining the vaccine intentions for the children and self for any VPD. Methods: Two separate studies were conducted on the representative samples of Serbian population; the first study investigated the intentions for child vaccination and the second study examined the vaccine intentions against any VPD, including adult vaccination. We used path analysis followed by logistic regression to analyze the data. Results: The results revealed high vaccine hesitancy motivated by the belief in the vaccine conspiracy theories, through its effect on reduced trust in medical science and institutions, and low objective vaccine knowledge.

As a vaccination effort, the study provided an empirical evidence on willingness to vaccinate by sociodemographic, clinical and regional differences in Bangladeshi adults. Methods This cross-sectional analysis from a household survey of 3646 adults aged 18 years or older was conducted in 8 districts of Bangladesh, from December 12, 2020, to January 7, 2021. Multinomial regression examined the impact of socio-demographic, clinical and healthcare-releated factors on hesitancy and reluctance of vaccination for COVID-19. Results Of the 3646 respondents (2212 men [60.7%]; mean [sd] age, 37.4 [13.9] years), 74.6% reported their willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19 when a safe and effective vaccine is available without a fee, while 8.5% were reluctant to vaccinate. With a minimum fee, 46.5% of the respondents showed intent to vaccinate. Among the respondents, 16.8% reported adequate adherence to health safety regulations, and 35.5% reported high confidence in the country's healthcare system. The COVID-19 vaccine refusal was significantly high in elderly, rural, semi-urban, and slum communities, farmers, day-laborers, homemakers, low-educated group, and those who had low confidence in the country's healthcare system. Also, the prevalence of vaccine hesitancy was high in the elderly population, low-educated group, day-laborers, people with chronic diseases, and people with low confidence in the country's healthcare system. Conclusion A high prevalence of vaccine refusal and hesitancy was observed in rural people and slum dwellers in Bangladesh. The rural community and slum dwellers had a low literacy level, low adherence to health safety regulations and low confidence in healthcare system. The ongoing app-based registration for vaccination increased hesitancy and reluctancy in low-educated group. For rural, semi-urban, and slum people, outreach centers for vaccination can be established to ensure the vaccine's nearby availability and limit associated travel costs. In rural areas, community health workers, valued community-leaders, and non-governmental organizations can be utilized to motivate and educate people for vaccination against COVID-19. Further, emphasis should be given to the elderly and diseased people with tailored health messages and assurance from healthcare professionals. The media may play a responsible role with the vaccine education program and eliminate the social stigma about the vaccination. Finally, vaccination should be continued without a fee and thus Bangladesh's COVID vaccination program can become a model for other low and middle-income countries.",,,,"Islam, Aminul/ABB-2055-2020; Hossain, Ahmed/H-4406-2012","Islam, Aminul/0000-0001-5636-3140; Abedin, Minhazul/0000-0002-7667-9270; Hossain, Ahmed/0000-0003-4575-1273; Arefin, Adittya/0000-0001-8886-7263; Rahman, Farah Naz/0000-0002-2265-2742",,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,APR 27,2021,16,4,,,,,,,e0250495,10.1371/journal.pone.0250495,,,,,,,WOS:000665456800020,33905442,,,,,,,,

However, vaccine hesitancy is widespread. Survey results on uptake intentions vary and continue to change. This review compared trends and synthesized findings in vaccination receptivity over time across US and international polls, assessing survey design influences and evaluating context to inform policies and practices. Data sources included academic literature (PubMed, Embase, and PsycINFO following PRISMA guidelines), news and official reports published by 20 October 2020. Two researchers independently screened potential peer-reviewed articles and syndicated polls for eligibility; 126 studies and surveys were selected. Declining vaccine acceptance (from >70% in March to <50% in October) with demographic, socioeconomic, and partisan divides was observed. Perceived risk, concerns over vaccine safety and effectiveness, doctors' recommendations, and inoculation history were common factors. Impacts of regional infection rates, gender, and personal COVID-19 experience were inconclusive. Unique COVID-19 factors included political party orientation, doubts toward expedited development/approval process, and perceived political interference. Many receptive participants preferred to wait until others have taken the vaccine; mandates could increase resistance. Survey wording and answer options showed influence on responses.

G.",,,A Proactive Approach for Managing COVID-19: The Importance of Understanding the Motivational Roots of Vaccination Hesitancy for SARS-CoV2,FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Importance Vaccination hesitancy-the reluctance or refusal to be vaccinated-is a leading global health threat (World Health Organization, 2019). It is imperative to identify the prevalence of vaccination hesitancy for SARS-CoV2 in order to understand the scope of the problem and to identify its motivational roots in order to proactively prepare to address the problem when a vaccine eventually becomes available. Objective To identify (1) the prevalence of vaccination hesitancy for a SARS-CoV2 vaccine, (2) the motivational roots of this hesitancy, and (3) the most promising incentives for improving the likelihood of vaccination uptake when a vaccine does become available. Design, Setting, and Participants A cross-sectional sample of 3,674 American and Canadian adults assessed during the COVID-19 pandemic in May 2020. Main Outcomes Measures of vaccination intention (i.e., If a vaccine for COVID-19 was available, would you get vaccinated?), attitudes toward vaccines in general and specific to SARS-CoV2 using the Vaccination Attitudes Examination Scale, and incentives for getting vaccinated for those who reported they would not get vaccinated. Results Many American (25%) and Canadian (20%) respondents said that they would not get vaccinated against SARS-CoV2 if a vaccine was available. Non-adherence rates of this magnitude would make it difficult or impossible to achieve herd immunity. Vaccine rejection was most strongly correlated with mistrust of vaccine benefit, and also correlated with worry about unforeseen future effects, concerns about commercial profiteering from pharmaceutical companies, and preferences for natural immunity. When asked about incentives for getting vaccinated, respondents were most likely to report that evidence for rigorous testing and safety of the vaccine were of greatest importance. Conclusions and Relevance Vaccination hesitancy is a major looming problem for COVID-19. To improve vaccine uptake, it is imperative that the vaccine is demonstrated to the public to be rigorously tested and not perceived as rushed or premature in its dissemination.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1664-1078,,,,,OCT 19,2020,11,,,,,,,,575950,10.3389/fpsyg.2020.575950,,,,,,,WOS:000583255500001,33192883,,,,,,,,

Trial design: This is a Phase III, randomized, multicenter, endpoint driven, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to assess the efficacy and safety of the adsorbed vaccine COVID-19 (inactivated) produced by Sinovac.The adsorbed vaccine COVID-19 (inactivated) produced by Sinovac (product under investigation) will be compared to placebo. Voluntary participants will be randomized to receive two intramuscular doses of the investigational product or the placebo, in a 1: 1 ratio, stratified by age group (18 to 59 years and 60 years or more) and will be monitored for one year by active surveillance of COVID-19. Two databases will be established according to the age groups: one for adults (18-59 years) and one for the elderly (60 years of age or older). The threshold to consider the vaccine efficacious will be to reach a protection level of at least 50%, as proposed by the World Health Organization and the FDA. Success in this criterion will be defined by sequential monitoring with adjustment of the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval above 30% for the primary efficacy endpoint. Participants: Healthy participants and / or participants with clinically controlled disease, of both genders, 18 years of age or older, working as health professionals performing care in units specialized in direct contact with people with possible or confirmed cases of COVID-19. Participation of pregnant women and those who are breastfeeding, as well as those intending to become pregnant within three months after vaccination will not be allowed. Participants will only be included after signing the voluntary Informed Consent Form and ensuring they undergo screening evaluation and conform to all the inclusion and exclusion criteria. All the clinical sites are located in Brazil. Intervention and comparator: Experimental intervention: The vaccine was manufactured by Sinovac Life Sciences (Beijing, China) and contains 3 mu g/0.5 mL (equivalent to 600 SU per dose) of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus, and aluminium hydroxide as adjuvant.Control comparator: The placebo contains aluminium hydroxide in a 0.5 mL solutionThe schedule of both, experimental intervention and placebo is two 0.5 mL doses IM (deltoid) with a two week interval. Main outcomes: The primary efficacy endpoint is the incidence of symptomatic cases of virologically confirmed COVID-19 two weeks after the second vaccination. The virological diagnosis will be confirmed by detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in a clinical sample.The primary safety endpoint is the frequency of solicited and unsolicited local and systemic adverse reactions during the period of one week after vaccination according to age group in adult (18-59 years old) and elder (60 years of age or older) subjects. Adverse reactions are defined as adverse events that have a reasonable causal relationship to vaccination. Randomisation: There will be two randomization lists, one for each age group, based on the investigational products to be administered, i.e., vaccine or placebo at a 1: 1 ratio. Each randomization list will be made to include up to 11,800 (18-59 year-old) adults, and 1,260 elderly (60 y-o and older) participants, the maximum number of participants needed per age group. An electronic central randomization system will be used to designate the investigational product that each participant must receive. Blinding (masking): This trial is designed as a double-blind study to avoid introducing bias in the evaluation of efficacy, safety and immunogenicity. The clinical care team, the professionals responsible for the vaccination and the participants will not know which investigational product will be administered. Only pharmacists or nurses in the study who are responsible for the randomization, separation and blinding of the investigational product will have access to unblinded information. The sponsor's operational team will also remain blind. Numbers to be randomised (sample size): The total number of participants needed to evaluate efficacy, 13,060 participants, satisfies the needed sample size calculated to evaluate safety. Therefore, the total number obtained for efficacy will be the number retained for the study. Up to 13,060 participants are expected to enter the study, with up to 11,800 participants aged 18 to 59 years and 1,260 elderly participants aged 60 and over. Half of the participants of each group will receive the experimental vaccine and half of them will receive the placebo. The recruitment of participants may be modified as recommended by the Data Safety Monitoring Committee at time of the interim unblinded analysis or blind assessment of the COVID-19 attack rate during the study.

Socio-behavioural science has been critical in elucidating the context and factors surrounding individual levels of engagement with known effective prevention and treatment tools for HIV, thus offering important lessons for ongoing efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Discussion Non-adherence to effective disease mitigation strategies (e.g. condoms for HIV and masks for COVID-19) can be attributed in part to prioritizing comfort, convenience and individual autonomy over public health. Importantly, misinformation can fuel denialism and conspiracies that discredit scientific knowledge and motivate nonadherence. These preferences and the extent to which individuals can act on their preferences may be constrained by the structures and culture in which they live. Both HIV and COVID-19 have been politicized and influenced by evolving recommendations from scientists, clinicians, policymakers and politically motivated organizations. While vaccines are vital for ending both pandemics, their impact will depend on availability and uptake. Four decades of experience with the HIV epidemic have shown that information alone is insufficient to overcome these challenges; interventions must address the underlying, often complex factors that influence human behaviour. This article builds from socio-behavioural science theory and describes practical and successful approaches to enable and support adherence to prevention and treatment strategies, including vaccine adoption. Key methods include reframing tools to enhance motivation, promoting centralized sources of trusted information, strategic development and messaging with and within key populations (e.g. through social media) and appealing to self-empowerment, altruism and informed decision making. Orchestrated evidence-based activism is needed to overcome manipulative politicization, while consistent transparent messaging around scientific discoveries and clinical recommendations are critical for public acceptance and support. Ultimately, the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines will depend on our ability to engender trust in the communities most affected. Conclusions Many lessons learned from socio-behavioural science in the HIV pandemic are applicable to the COVID-19 pandemic. Individual behaviour must be understood within its interpersonal and societal context to address the current barriers to adherence to disease-mitigating strategies and promote an effective response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which is likely to be endured for the foreseeable future.",,,,,"Haberer, Jessica/0000-0001-5845-3190; Andrasik, Michele/0000-0003-1952-7825",,,,,,,,,,,,,1758-2652,,,,AUG,2021,24,8,,,,,,,e25771,10.1002/jia2.25771,,,,,,,WOS:000692344800008,34339113,,,,,,,,

At present, there is no successful cure or vaccine for both COVID-19 and HIV. People with underlying conditions, including HIV, are at increased risk of severe COVID-19 manifestations. This underscores the need to enhance the knowledge, attitudes, and practice of people living with HIV (PLWH) to protect this population against COVID-19. An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from August 31 to September 18, 2020 among 376 participants who were selected by a simple random sampling technique. A pretested and structured self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. Quality scores were calculated as a measure of the participants' knowledge, attitudes, and practice (KAP) levels. The student t-test was used to compare continuous variables between low (<65%) and high (>= 65%) KAP scores. The chi-square test was used to determine the association between KAP scores and categorical variables. All decisions on statistical tests were concluded at 5% level of significance. All statistical analysis was performed using STATA statistical package version 11.2 (STATA Corp., Texas, USA). Of the 376 participants, 363 (97%) obtained a high knowledge score, while more than a quarter of the participants (26%) had a poor attitude score, and the majority (90%) having a high practice score. There was no association between gender, age, place of residence, employment, or duration on ART and knowledge score. Employment status and duration on antiretroviral treatment (ART) were significantly associated with attitude scores (p = 0.004 and p = 0.013, respectively). Gender and duration on ART were significantly associated with practice scores (p = 0.02 and p = 0.012, respectively). There was a moderate positive correlation (r = 0.57) between knowledge and attitude scores, and knowledge and practice scores (r = 0.55). There was a strong positive correlation (r = 0.67) between attitude scores and practice scores.

J,"Brereton, C; Pedercini, M",,,,"Brereton, Claire; Pedercini, Matteo",,,COVID-19 Case Rates in the UK: Modelling Uncertainties as Lockdown Lifts,SYSTEMS,,,,,,,,,,,,"Background: The UK was one of the countries worst affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe. A strict lockdown from early 2021 combined with an aggressive vaccination programme enabled a gradual easing of lockdown measures to be introduced whilst both deaths and reported case numbers reduced to less than 3% of their peak. The emergence of the Delta variant in April 2021 has reversed this trend, and the UK is once again experiencing surging cases, albeit with reduced average severity due to the success of the vaccination rollout. This study presents the results of a modelling exercise which simulates the progression of the pandemic in the UK through projection of daily case numbers as lockdown lifts. Methods: A simulation model based on the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered structure was built. A timeline of UK lockdown measures was used to simulate the changing restrictions. The model was tailored for the UK, with some values set based on research and others obtained through calibration against 16 months of historical data. Results: The model projects that if lockdown restrictions are lifted in July 2021, UK COVID-19 cases will peak at hundreds of thousands daily in most viable scenarios, reducing in late 2021 as immunity acquired through both vaccination and infection reduces the susceptible population percentage. Further lockdown measures can be used to reduce daily cases. Other than the ever-present threat of the emergence of new variants, the most significant unknown factors affecting the profile of the pandemic in the UK are the length and strength of immunity, with daily peak cases over 50% higher if immunity lasts 8 months compared to 12 months. Another significant factor is the percentage of unreported cases. The reduced case severity associated with vaccination may lead to a higher proportion of unreported mild or asymptomatic cases, meaning that unmanaged infections resulting from unknown cases will continue to be a major source of infection. Conclusions: Further research into the length and strength of both recovered and vaccinated COVID-19 immunity is critical to delivering more accurate projections from models, thus enabling more finely tuned policy decisions. The model presented in this article, whilst by no means perfect, aims to contribute to greater transparency of the modelling process, which can only increase trust between policy makers, journalists and the general public.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2079-8954,,,,SEP,2021,9,3,,,,,,,60,10.3390/systems9030060,,,,,,,WOS:000700177500001,,,,,,,,,

Vaccine-promoting policymaking for public engagement is a prerequisite for social mobilization. However, making an informed and judicious choice is a dilemma for the Chinese government in the vaccine promotion context. Objective: In this study, public opinions in China were analyzed via dialogues on Chinese social media, based on which Chinese netizens' views on COVID-19 vaccines and vaccination were investigated. We also aimed to develop strategies for promoting vaccination programs in China based on an in-depth understanding of the challenges in risk communication and social mobilization. Methods: We proposed a novel behavioral dynamics model, SRS/I (susceptible-reading-susceptible/immune), to analyze opinion transmission paradigms on Chinese social media. Coupled with a meta-analysis and natural language processing techniques, the emotion polarity of individual opinions was examined in their given context. Results: We collected more than 1.75 million Weibo messages about COVID-19 vaccines from January to October 2020. According to the public opinion reproduction ratio (R-0), the dynamic propagation of those messages can be classified into three periods: the ferment period (R-01=1.1360), the revolution period (R-02=2.8278), and the transmission period (R-03=3.0729). Topics on COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in China include price and side effects. From September to October, Weibo users claimed that the vaccine was overpriced, making up 18.3% (n=899) of messages; 38.1% (n=81,909) of relevant topics on Weibo received likes. On the contrary, the number of messages that considered the vaccine to be reasonably priced was twice as high but received fewer likes, accounting for 25.0% (n=53,693). In addition, we obtained 441 (47.7%) positive and 295 (31.9%) negative Weibo messages about side effects. Interestingly, inactivated vaccines instigated more heated discussions than any other vaccine type. The discussions, forwards, comments, and likes associated with topics related to inactivated vaccines accounted for 53% (n=588), 42% (n=3072), 56% (n=3671), and 49% (n=17,940), respectively, of the total activity associated with the five types of vaccines in China. Conclusions: Most Chinese netizens believe that the vaccine is less expensive than previously thought, while some claim they cannot afford it for their entire family. The findings demonstrate that Chinese individuals are inclined to be positive about side effects over time and are proud of China's involvement with vaccine development. Nevertheless, they have a collective misunderstanding about inactivated vaccines, insisting that inactivated vaccines are safer than other vaccines. Reflecting on netizens' collective responses, the unfolding determinants of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance provide illuminating benchmarks for vaccine-promoting policies.",,,,"Hu, Zhiwen/L-6013-2018","Hu, Zhiwen/0000-0002-0382-7770; Yin, Fulian/0000-0002-9981-0331",,,,,,,,,,,,1438-8871,,,,,JAN 15,2021,23,1,,,,,,,e26089,10.2196/26089,,,,,,,WOS:000608113000006,33400682,,,,,,,,
J,"Tsyganov, V",,,,"Tsyganov, Vladimir",,,"Artificial intelligence, public control, and supply of a vital commodity like COVID-19 vaccine",AI & SOCIETY,,,,,,,,,,,,"The article examines the problem of ensuring the political stability of a democratic social system with a shortage of a vital commodity (like vaccine against COVID-19). In such a system, members of society citizens assess the authorities. Thus, actions by the authorities to increase the supply of this commodity can contribute to citizens' approval and hence political stability. However, this supply is influenced by random factors, the actions of competitors, etc. Therefore, citizens do not have sufficient information about all the possibilities of supplying, and it is difficult for them to make the right decisions. Such citizen unawareness can be exploited by unscrupulous politicians to achieve personal targets. Therefore, it is necessary to organize public control to motivate politicians to use all available opportunities in supplying. The goal of the paper is to build such a digital mechanism of public control of the politicians by citizens, which would best assess and stimulate the activities of the authorities to improve the supply of a vital commodity. In the age of artificial intelligence, such digital public control in the face of uncertainty can be based on digital machine learning. In addition, it is necessary to take into account and model the activities of politicians associated with the presence of their own targets that do not coincide with public ones. Such politicians can use the learning of citizens for their own targets. The objective of the article is to build an optimal digital mechanism of public control in a two-level model of a democratic social system-a digital society. At its top level, there is the Citizen, who gives an assessment for the Politico located at the lower level. In turn, the Politico can influence the supplying of a vital commodity. Political stability is guaranteed if the Citizen regularly approves of the Politico's actions to increase this supply. However, the Politico may not use the opportunities available to him to offer a commodity to achieve a personal target. To avoid this, the Politico's control mechanism is proposed. It includes the procedure for digital learning of the Citizen, as well as a procedure for assessing the Politico activity. Sufficient conditions have been found for the synthesis of such the Politico's control mechanism, at which stochastic possibilities of increasing the supply of a vital commodity are used. The example of such the Politico's control mechanism is considered on the case of supply of the COVID-19 vaccine in England.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0951-5666,1435-5655,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s00146-021-01293-y,,OCT 2021,,,,,WOS:000708221900001,34690448,,,,,,,,

However, their acceptance is only partial, with vaccine hesitancy and refusal representing a major health threat. Influenza vaccines have low compliance since repeated, annual vaccination is required. Influenza vaccines stimulate discussions both in the real world and online. Social media is currently a significant source of health and medical information. Elucidating the association between social media engagement and influenza vaccination is important and may be applicable to other vaccines, including ones against COVID-19. Objective: The goal of this study is to characterize profiles of social media engagement regarding the influenza vaccine and their association with knowledge and compliance in order to support improvement of future web-associated vaccination campaigns. Methods: A weblink to an online survey in Hebrew was disseminated over social media and messaging platforms. The survey answers were collected during April 2020. Anonymous and volunteer participants aged 21 years and over answered 30 questions related to sociodemographics; social media usage; influenza- and vaccine-related knowledge and behavior; health-related information searching, its reliability, and its influence; and COVID-19-related information searching. A univariate descriptive data analysis was performed, followed by multivariate analysis via building a decision tree to define the most important attributes associated with vaccination compliance. Results: A total of 213 subjects responded to the survey, of whom 207 were included in the analysis; the majority of the respondents were female, were aged 21 to 40 years, had 1 to 2 children, lived in central Israel, were secular Israeli natives, had higher education, and had a salary close to the national average. Most respondents (128/207, 61.8%) were not vaccinated against influenza in 2019 and used social media. Participants that used social media were younger, secular, and living in high-density agglomerations and had lower influenza vaccination rates. The perceived influence and reliability of the information on social media about COVID-19 were generally similar to those perceptions about influenza. Conclusions: Using social media is negatively linked to compliance with seasonal influenza vaccination in this study. A high proportion of noncompliant individuals can lead to increased consumption of health care services and can, therefore, overload these health services. This is particularly crucial with a concomitant outbreak, such as COVID-19. Health care professionals should use improved and targeted health communication campaigns with the aid of experts in social media. Targeted communication, based on sociodemographic factors and personalized social media usage, might increase influenza vaccination rates and compliance with other vaccines as well.",,,,"Benis, Arriel/M-6262-2016; Ashkenazi, Shai/V-7996-2019","Benis, Arriel/0000-0002-9125-8300; Ashkenazi, Shai/0000-0001-7244-0679",,,,,,,,,,,,1438-8871,,,,,MAR 16,2021,23,3,,,,,,,e25977,10.2196/25977,,,,,,,WOS:000636180100007,33651709,,,,,,,,

The secondary objectives include evaluating the efficacy after at least one dose of the vaccine against RT-PCR confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 cases; the efficacy of two doses of the vaccine on the rates of hospitalization and death; the safety of the vaccine including adverse reactions up to one year after the 2(nd) dose of vaccination; and the immunogenicity of the vaccine and its duration up to 120 days.Trial DesignThis is a phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled case driven clinical trial to assess the efficacy and safety of the vaccine. The study is planned to be carried out within two separate cohorts in voluntary participants aged between 18-59 years old. The first cohort includes healthcare professionals actively working in healthcare units, who are assumed to have higher risk of acquiring COVID-19, and the second cohort includes other immunocompetent subjects in the same age group, who are at a regular risk for COVID-19 disease. In Cohort 1, healthcare professionals will be randomized to receive two intramuscular doses of investigational product or the placebo in a 1:1 ratio and they will be monitored for 12 months by active surveillance of COVID-19. In Cohort 2, immunocompetent subjects will be randomized to receive vaccine or the placebo in a 2:1 ratio.ParticipantsHealthcare professionals of both genders, including medical doctors, nurses, cleaners, hospital technicians, and administrative personnel who work in any department of a healthcare unit and immunocompetent individuals of both genders are included. Pregnant (confirmed by positive beta-hCG test) and breastfeeding women as well as those intending to become pregnant within three months after vaccination are excluded. Other exclusion criteria include history of COVID-19 test positivity (PCR or immunoglobulin test results), any form of immunosuppressive therapy including corticosteroids within 6 months, history of bleeding disorders, asplenia, and administration of any form of immunoglobulins or blood products within 3 months.Exclusion criteria for the second dose include any serious adverse events related with the vaccine, anaphylaxis or hypersensitivity after vaccination, or any confirmed or suspected autoimmune or immunosuppressive disease (including HIV infection).Participants are only included after signing the voluntary informed consent form, ensuring cooperation in visits, undergoing screening for evaluation, and conforming to all the inclusion and exclusion criteria. All clinical sites are located in Turkey.Intervention and comparatorThe vaccine was manufactured by Sinovac Research & Development Co., Ltd. It is a preparation made from a novel coronavirus (strain CZ02) grown in the kidney cell cultures (Vero Cell) of the African green monkey and contains inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus, aluminium hydroxide, disodium hydrogen phosphate, sodium dihydrogen phosphate, and sodium chloride. A dose of 0.5 mL contains 600 SU of SARS-CoV-2 virus antigen. The placebo contains aluminium hydroxide, disodium hydrogen phosphate, sodium dihydrogen phosphate, and sodium chloride (0.5mL/dose). Scheduled visits and additional unscheduled weekly visits will be performed for the first 13 weeks and neutralizing antibody test, IgG test, T-Cell activation test, pregnancy test, and RT-PCR tests along with total antibody test will be performed. Adverse events and serious adverse events during the follow-up will be recorded on diary cards. Diary cards will collect information on the timing and severity of COVID-19 symptoms and solicited adverse events recorded by the subjects during one-year follow-up period. All serious adverse events will be managed and necessary treatment will be ensured according to the local regulations. All serious adverse events following vaccination will be reported to the ethics committee, the Ministry of Health, and the study sponsor within 24 hours of detection.Main OutcomesThe primary efficacy endpoint is the incidence of symptomatic cases of COVID-19 disease confirmed by RT-PCR two weeks after the second dose of vaccination. Secondary efficacy endpoints are the incidence of hospitalization/mortality rates among one or two dose regimens, duration of immunogenicity rates up to 120 days, the seroconversion rate, the seropositivity rate, neutralizing antibody titer, and IgG levels 14 days after each dose of vaccination. The primary safety endpoint is the severity and frequency of local and systemic adverse reactions during the period of one week after vaccination. The study would be terminated if more than 15% of the subjects have grade >= 3 adverse events related to vaccination including local reactions.RandomisationEligible subjects will be randomized at their Study Day 0 to two study groups using an Interactive Web Response System (IWRS; developed by Omega CRO, Ankara, Turkey) in both risk groups. The IWRS system customizes the randomization algorithm. After enrolment in the study, each participant will be randomly assigned to either of the two treatment arms at a ratio of 1:1 in the high-risk group and at a ratio of 2:1 in the normal risk group. Each enrolled participant will be assigned to a code and will receive the treatment labelled with the code.Blinding (masking)The trial is a double-blind study to avoid introducing bias. The blinding may be broken by the investigator in the event of a medical emergency in which knowledge of the identity of the study vaccine is critical for management of the subject's immediate treatment. The Data and Safety Monitoring Board is to be contacted in case of breaking the blinding for a study object. The blood samples will be taken from both placebo and vaccinated groups, in order not to break the blinding.Numbers to be randomised (sample size)The study is planned to be carried out with two separate cohorts. The Cohort 1 includes healthcare professionals working in healthcare units and the Cohort 2 consists of immunocompetent subjects having normal risk for COVID-19 disease. The Cohort 2 will be initiated after the evaluation of the interim safety report of the Cohort 1 by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board. Both cohorts will be followed-up via RT-PCR to confirm symptomatic COVID-19 cases. If the clinical efficacy of the vaccine is shown in the Cohort 1 or 2, the subjects randomized into the placebo arm will also be vaccinated. In the Cohort 1, 588 subjects should be included in both arms with the assumption that the risk of infection with COVID-19 will be 5% for the placebo arm and 2% for the vaccine arm in the high-risk group. Considering 10% of drop-out rate and 5% of seropositivity or PCR positivity at baseline, 680 subjects should be screened at both arms of the Cohort 1. Group sample sizes of 7545 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and 3773 placebo suits at a two-sided 95% confidence interval for the difference in population proportions with a width equal to 1.0%, when the estimated incidence rate for vaccinated group is 1.0% and the estimated incidence rate for placebo group is 2.0%. Drop-out rate is assumed to be 10% and seropositivity or PCR positivity at baseline is assumed to be 5%; accordingly, 13000 participants are needed to be enrolled totally in both cohorts. The remaining 11640 subjects will be screened in the Cohort 2 and eligible subjects will be randomized at a ratio of 2:1.Trial StatusProtocol version 6.0 - 15 October 2020.

Dried blood spots (DBS), which can be collected in nonclinical settings, provide a minimally invasive alternative to serum for serosurveys. We developed a Luminex-based SARS-CoV-2 microsphere immunoassay (MIA) for DBS that detects IgG antibodies to nucleocapsid (N) and spike subunit 1 (S1) antigens. The assay uses a 384-well plate format and automated liquid handlers for high-throughput capacity. Specificity was assessed using a large collection of prepandemic DBS and well-characterized sera. Sensitivity was analyzed using serology data from New York State SARS-CoV-2 serosurvey testing and matched diagnostic test results. For DBS, the specificity was 99.5% for the individual N and S1 antigens. Median fluorescence intensity (MFI) values for DBS and paired sera showed a strong positive correlation for N (R-2 = 0.91) and S1 (R-2 = 0.93). Sensitivity, assessed from 1,134 DBS with prior laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, ranged from 83% at 0 to 20 days to 95% at 61 to 90 days after a positive test. When stratified using coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptom data, sensitivity ranged from 90 to 96% for symptomatic and 77 to 91% for asymptomatic individuals. For 8,367 health care workers reporting detailed symptom data, MFI values were significantly higher for all symptom categories. Our results indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 IgG DBS MIA is sensitive, specific, and well-suited for large populationbased serosurveys. The ability to readily modify and multiplex antigens is important for ongoing assessment of SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses to emerging variants and vaccines. IMPORTANCE Testing for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 has been used to estimate the prevalence of COVID-19 in different populations. Seroprevalence studies, or serosurveys, were especially useful during the early phase of the pandemic when diagnostic testing was not widely available, and the resulting seroprevalence estimates played an important role in public health decision making. To achieve meaningful results, antibody tests used for serosurveys should be accurate and accessible to diverse populations. We developed a test that detects antibodies to two different SARS-CoV-2 proteins in dried blood spots (DBS). DBS require only a simple fingerstick and can be collected in nonclinical settings. We conducted a robust validation study and have demonstrated that our test is both sensitive and specific. Furthermore, we demonstrated that our test is suitable for large-scale serosurveys by testing over 56,000 DBS collected in a variety of community-based venues in New York State during the spring of 2020.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2165-0497,,,,,SEP,2021,9,1,,,,,,,e00134-21,10.1128/Spectrum.00134-21,,,,,,,WOS:000703076500031,34319133,,,,,,,,

Evidence-based strategies about vaccination of vulnerable children during all health care visits are especially important during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE To design and evaluate a clinical decision support (CDS) strategy to increase the proportion of eligible hospitalized children who receive a seasonal influenza vaccine prior to inpatient discharge. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This quality improvement study was conducted among children eligible for the seasonal influenza vaccine who were hospitalized in a tertiary pediatric health system providing care to more than half a million patients annually in 3 hospitals. The study used a sequential crossover design from control to intervention and compared hospitalizations in the intervention group (2019-2020 season with the use of an intervention order set) with concurrent controls (2019-2020 season without use of an intervention order set) and historical controls (2018-2019 season with use of an order set that underwent intervention during the 2019-2020 season). INTERVENTION A CDS intervention was developed through a user-centered design process, including (1) placing a default influenza vaccine order into admission order sets for eligible patients, (2) a script to offer the vaccine using a presumptive strategy, and (3) just-in-time education for clinicians addressing vaccine eligibility in the influenza order group with links to further reference material. The intervention was rolled out in a stepwise fashion during the 2019-2020 influenza season. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Proportion of eligible hospitalizations in which 1 or more influenza vaccines were administered prior to discharge. RESULTS Among 17 740 hospitalizations (9295 boys [52%]), the mean (SD) age was 8.0 (6.0) years, and the patients were predominantly Black (n = 8943 [50%]) or White (n = 7559 [43%]) and mostly had public insurance (n = 11 274 [64%]). There were 10 997 hospitalizations eligible for the influenza vaccine in the 2019-2020 season. Of these, 5449 (50%) were in the intervention group, and 5548 (50%) were concurrent controls. There were 6743 eligible hospitalizations in 2018-2019 that served as historical controls. Vaccine administration rates were 31% (n = 1676) in the intervention group, 19% (n = 1051) in concurrent controls, and 14% (n = 912) in historical controls (P < .001). In adjusted analyses, the odds of receiving the influenza vaccine were 3.25 (95% CI, 2.94-3.59) times higher in the intervention group and 1.28 (95% CI, 1.15-1.42) times higher in concurrent controls than in historical controls. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This quality improvement study suggests that user-centered CDS may be associated with significantly improved influenza vaccination rates among hospitalized children. Stepwise implementation of CDS interventions was a practical method that was used to increase quality improvement rigor through comparison with historical and concurrent controls.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2574-3805,,,,,JUL 22,2021,4,7,,,,,,,e2117809,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.17809,,,,,,,WOS:000676010700003,34292335,,,,,,,,

The evidence base for health and economic impact of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination in low- and middle-income settings is limited.</p> Searching PubMed, medRxiv, and econLit using the search term (coronavirus OR covid OR ncov) AND (vaccination OR immunisation) AND (model OR cost OR economic) for full text articles published in any language between 1 January 2020 and 20 January 2021, returned 29 (PubMed), 1,167 (medRxiv), and 0 (econLit) studies: 20 overall were relevant, with only 4 exclusively focused on low- or middle-income countries (India, China, Mexico), while 3 multicountry analyses also included low- or middle-income settings.</p> However, only 3 of these studies are considered economic outcomes, all of them comparing the costs of vaccination to the costs of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and concluding that both are necessary to reduce infections and maximise economic benefit.</p> The majority of studies are set in high-income settings and conclude that targeting COVID-19 vaccination to older age groups is the preferred strategy to minimise mortality, particularly when vaccine supplies are constrained, while other age- or occupational risk groups should be prioritised when vaccine availability increases or when other policy objectives are pursued.</p> What did the researchers do and find? We combined epidemiological and economic analysis of COVID-19 vaccination based on real-world disease and programmatic information in the Sindh Province of Pakistan.</p> We found that vaccination in this setting is likely to be highly cost-effective, and even cost saving, as long as the vaccine is reasonably priced and efficacy is high.</p> Unlike studies in high-income settings, we also found that vaccination programmes targeting all adults may have almost as much benefit as those initially targeted at older populations, likely reflecting the higher previous infection rates and different demography in these settings.</p> What do these findings mean? The results suggest that low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) see less benefit to initially prioritising vaccination of older (65+) populations compared to unprioritised distribution. Factors outside this analysis, like cost differences between prioritised and unprioritised programmes, will further influence the preferred approach.</p> As such, LMICs and international bodies providing guidance for LMICs need to consider evidence specific to these settings when making recommendations about COVID-19 vaccination.</p> Further data and model-based analyses in such settings are urgently needed in order to ensure that vaccination decisions are appropriate to these contexts.</p> Background Multiple Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines appear to be safe and efficacious, but only high-income countries have the resources to procure sufficient vaccine doses for most of their eligible populations. The World Health Organization has published guidelines for vaccine prioritisation, but most vaccine impact projections have focused on high-income countries, and few incorporate economic considerations. To address this evidence gap, we projected the health and economic impact of different vaccination scenarios in Sindh Province, Pakistan (population: 48 million).</p> Methods and findings We fitted a compartmental transmission model to COVID-19 cases and deaths in Sindh from 30 April to 15 September 2020. We then projected cases, deaths, and hospitalisation outcomes over 10 years under different vaccine scenarios. Finally, we combined these projections with a detailed economic model to estimate incremental costs (from healthcare and partial societal perspectives), disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for each scenario.</p> We project that 1 year of vaccine distribution, at delivery rates consistent with COVAX projections, using an infection-blocking vaccine at $3/dose with 70% efficacy and 2.5-year duration of protection is likely to avert around 0.9 (95% credible interval (CrI): 0.9, 1.0) million cases, 10.1 (95% CrI: 10.1, 10.3) thousand deaths, and 70.1 (95% CrI: 69.9, 70.6) thousand DALYs, with an ICER of $27.9 per DALY averted from the health system perspective. Under a broad range of alternative scenarios, we find that initially prioritising the older (65+) population generally prevents more deaths. However, unprioritised distribution has almost the same cost-effectiveness when considering all outcomes, and both prioritised and unprioritised programmes can be cost-effective for low per-dose costs. High vaccine prices ($10/dose), however, may not be cost-effective, depending on the specifics of vaccine performance, distribution programme, and future pandemic trends.</p> The principal drivers of the health outcomes are the fitted values for the overall transmission scaling parameter and disease natural history parameters from other studies, particularly age-specific probabilities of infection and symptomatic disease, as well as social contact rates. Other parameters are investigated in sensitivity analyses.</p> This study is limited by model approximations, available data, and future uncertainty. Because the model is a single-population compartmental model, detailed impacts of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) such as household isolation cannot be practically represented or evaluated in combination with vaccine programmes. Similarly, the model cannot consider prioritising groups like healthcare or other essential workers. The model is only fitted to the reported case and death data, which are incomplete and not disaggregated by, e.g., age. Finally, because the future impact and implementation cost of NPIs are uncertain, how these would interact with vaccination remains an open question.</p> Conclusions COVID-19 vaccination can have a considerable health impact and is likely to be cost-effective if more optimistic vaccine scenarios apply. Preventing severe disease is an important contributor to this impact. However, the advantage of prioritising older, high-risk populations is smaller in generally younger populations. This reduction is especially true in populations with more past transmission, and if the vaccine is likely to further impede transmission rather than just disease. Those conditions are typical of many low- and middle-income countries. </p>",,,,,"Bozzani, Fiammetta/0000-0002-9518-6885; Keogh-Brown, Marcus/0000-0002-7556-0016; Huda, Maryam/0000-0002-7409-4965; Pearson, Carl/0000-0003-0701-7860; Procter, Simon/0000-0002-0380-1503",,,,,,,,,,,,1549-1277,1549-1676,,,,OCT,2021,18,10,,,,,,,e1003815,10.1371/journal.pmed.1003815,,,,,,,WOS:000703370200003,34606520,,,,,,,,

Understanding the ability to develop vaccine-specific immunity to COVID-19 in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) treated with B-cell-depleting therapy is of importance for clinical decisions. OBJECTIVE To assess SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-specific humoral and cellular responses in patients treated with ocrelizumab compared with healthy controls. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This single-center study performed at Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem, Israel, included patients with MS treated with ocrelizumab, healthy controls, and untreated patients with MS. Vaccination occurred between December 2020 and April 2021. Participants donated blood 2 to 4 and 2 to 8 weeks after the second vaccine dose for antibody and T-cell assessments, respectively. EXPOSURES All participants received 2 doses of BNT162b2 vaccine (Pfizer/BioNTech) and completed the study. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Proportion of patients treated with ocrelizumab with SARS-CoV-2-specific serology and/or T-cell responses following vaccination. All participants underwent SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing; 29 patients treated with ocrelizumab and 15 healthy controls had evaluation of SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses. RESULTS Of 112 participants, 49 (43.8%) had MS and were treated with ocrelizumab (33 [67.3%] female; mean [SD] age, 47.9 [13.3] years), 23 (20.5%) had MS and were not treated with disease-modifying therapies (18 [78.3%] female; mean [SD] age, 49 [13.4] years), and 40 (35.7%) were healthy controls (25 [62.5%] female; mean [SD] age, 45.3 [16] years). Twenty-six of 29 patients (89.7%) treated with ocrelizumab and 15 of 15 healthy controls (100%) had SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells following vaccination at similar levels (mean [SD], 15.4 [7.6] and 14.3 [6.3] spot-forming cells, respectively). Mean antibody titers and positive serology rate were lower in the group of patients treated with ocrelizumab (mean [SD] antibody titers and positive serology rate, 26.2 [49.2] and 376.5 [907.6] AU/mL; 10 of 40 [25%] and 20 of 49 [40.8%] for S1/S2 and receptor-binding domain, respectively) compared with healthy controls (mean [SD] antibody titers and positive serology rate, 283 [100] and 12 712 [9114] AU/mL; 100% S1/S2 and receptor-binding domain) and untreated patients (mean [SD] antibody titers and positive serology rate, 288.3 [113.8] and 10 877 [9476] AU/mL; 100% S1/S2 and receptor-binding domain), with positive association to time from ocrelizumab infusion (S1/S2: r = 0.7, P < .001; receptor-binding domain: r = 0.4, P = .04). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE In this study, patients with MS who were treated with ocrelizumab generated comparable SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses with healthy controls and had lower antibody response following vaccination. Given the potential role of T cells in protection from severe disease, this is reassuring and will help physicians develop consensus guidelines regardingMS treatment in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic.",,,,,"Zveik, Omri/0000-0002-8878-4211",,,,,,,,,,,,2168-6149,2168-6157,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1001/jamaneurol.2021.3599,,SEP 2021,,,,,WOS:000698779400002,34554197,,,,,,,,

Scientists presently speculate this coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, originated in a bat and by one way or another jumped to another creature, potentially the pangolin, which at that point gave it to people. The ailment is currently spreading between individuals with no animal delegate. Researchers are struggling to follow the infection back to where it started to become familiar with its spread. In the event that, for example, specialists can locate the soonest cases, they might have the option to distinguish the creature have where the infection hides. In March and April 2020, researchers detailed that this virus created normally. Coronavirus has been become of the serious global phenomena in the recent years and has negative effects in the entire world health and economy. The virus is believed to have been associated with a host animal which human contracted. Subsequently, human-to-human infection began. Through migration as humans have become complex with easy mobility the disease has traveled to the entire continent. Now, numerous scientist are going on in the hope of obtaining medication and vaccination to prevent the spread of the disease and mortality of the disease. It is important that we obtain quantitative and qualitative information about the etiology of this disease which is crucial. Mathematical modeling is capable of providing qualitative information on many parameters that guides the decision making of health practitioners. In this work we focus the optimal control of COVID-19 with the help of Non Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs). To find the role of factors/parameters in the transmission of the syndrome we find Ro; the ratio of reproduction for the proposed model. Methods: To find the role of parameters in the transmission of the syndrome we find Ro; the ratio of reproduction for the proposed model. On the basis of sensitivity indices of the parameters we apply Non Pharmaceutical Interventions(NPIs) to control the sensitive parameters and hence formulate the optimal control mode. With the help of Hamiltonian and Lagrangian we minimize the density of contaminated stuff and infected human population. Results: We focus the optimal control of COVID-19 with the help of Non Pharmaceutical Interventions(NPIs). On the basis of sensitivity indices of the parameters we apply Non Pharmaceutical Interventions(NPIs) to control the sensitive parameters and hence formulate the optimal control model. The major NPIs are, STAY HOME, SANITIZER (wash hands), EARLY CASE DETECTION (PCR Test) and FACE MASK. These NPIs helps in mitigation and reducing the size of outbreak of the disease. Conclusion: We check the existence of the optimal solution for the system. At the end, Using matlab we produce numerical simulations for validation of results of control variables.

The focus is on the government's (mis-)management of its non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) (or lockdown) to stem the pandemic and the organized business sector's resistance against the lockdown. Design/methodology/approach This paper makes use of a literature review and provides descriptive statistics and quantitative analysis of COVID-19 and the lockdown stringency in South Africa, based on data from Google Mobility Trends, Oxford University's Stringency Index, Johns Hopkins University's COVID-19 tracker and Our World in Data. Findings This paper finds that both the government and the business sector's responses to the COVID-19 pandemic have been problematic. These key actors have been failing to pull together, leaving South Africa's citizens in-between corrupt and incompetent officials on the one hand, and lockdown skeptics on the other. This paper argues that to break through this impasse, the country should change direction by agreeing on a smart or Goldilocks lockdown, based on data, testing, decentralization, demographics and appropriate economic support measures, including export support. Such a Goldilocks lockdown is argued, based on available evidence from the emerging scientific literature, to be able to save lives, improve trust in government, limit economic damages and moreover improve the country's long-term recovery prospects. Research limitations/implications The pandemic is an unprecedented crisis and moreover was still unfolding at the time of writing. This has two implications. First, precise data on the economic impact and certain epidemiological parameters was not (yet) available. Second, the causes of the mismanagement by the government are not clear yet, within such a short time frame. More research and better data may be able in future to allow conclusions to be drawn whether the problems that were besetting the country's management of COVID-19 are unique or perhaps part of a more general problem across developing countries. Practical implications The paper provides clear practical implications for both government and organized business. The South African Government should not altogether end its lockdown measures, but follow a smart and flexible lockdown. The organized business sector should abandon its calls for ending the lockdown while the country is still among the most affected countries in the world, and no vaccine is available. Social implications There should be better collaboration between government, business and civil society to manage a smart lockdown. Government should re-establish lost trust because of the mismanagement of the lockdown during the first six months of the pandemic. Originality/value The outline of the smart lockdown that is proposed for the country combines NPIs with the promotion of exports, as a policy intervention to help aggregate demand to recover. The paper provides advice on how to resolve an impasse created by mismanagement of COVID-19, which could be valuable for decision-making during a crisis, particularly in developing countries.",,,,"Naude, Wim/E-3812-2017","Naude, Wim/0000-0003-2496-6945",,,,,,,,,,,,1750-6166,1750-6174,,,,JUN 23,2021,15,2,,,SI,,219,235,,10.1108/TG-09-2020-0276,,JAN 2021,,,,,WOS:000607838200001,,,,,,,,,
J,"Kandula, S; Shaman, J",,,,"Kandula, Sasikiran; Shaman, Jeffrey",,,Investigating associations between COVID-19 mortality and population-level health and socioeconomic indicators in the United States: A modeling study,PLOS MEDICINE,,,,,,,,,,,,"Background With the availability of multiple Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines and the predicted shortages in supply for the near future, it is necessary to allocate vaccines in a manner that minimizes severe outcomes, particularly deaths. To date, vaccination strategies in the United States have focused on individual characteristics such as age and occupation. Here, we assess the utility of population-level health and socioeconomic indicators as additional criteria for geographical allocation of vaccines. Methods and findings County-level estimates of 14 indicators associated with COVID-19 mortality were extracted from public data sources. Effect estimates of the individual indicators were calculated with univariate models. Presence of spatial autocorrelation was established using Moran's I statistic. Spatial simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) models that account for spatial autocorrelation in response and predictors were used to assess (i) the proportion of variance in county-level COVID-19 mortality that can explained by identified health/socioeconomic indicators (R-2); and (ii) effect estimates of each predictor. Adjusting for case rates, the selected indicators individually explain 24%-29% of the variability in mortality. Prevalence of chronic kidney disease and proportion of population residing in nursing homes have the highest R-2. Mortality is estimated to increase by 43 per thousand residents (95% CI: 37-49; p < 0.001) with a 1% increase in the prevalence of chronic kidney disease and by 39 deaths per thousand (95% CI: 34-44; p < 0.001) with 1% increase in population living in nursing homes. SAR models using multiple health/socioeconomic indicators explain 43% of the variability in COVID-19 mortality in US counties, adjusting for case rates. R-2 was found to be not sensitive to the choice of SAR model form. Study limitations include the use of mortality rates that are not age standardized, a spatial adjacency matrix that does not capture human flows among counties, and insufficient accounting for interaction among predictors. Conclusions Significant spatial autocorrelation exists in COVID-19 mortality in the US, and population health/socioeconomic indicators account for a considerable variability in county-level mortality. In the context of vaccine rollout in the US and globally, national and subnational estimates of burden of disease could inform optimal geographical allocation of vaccines. Author summary Why was this study done? We are interested in evaluating strategies for optimal geographical allocation of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines. We hypothesized that health and socioeconomic indicators of a location can be used to model differential risk of COVID-19 mortality, and, hence, inform vaccine prioritization strategies. What did the researchers do and find? Using spatial simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) models and small-area prevalence estimates for US counties, we found that 43% of the variability in COVID-19 mortality can be explained by the considered health and socioeconomic indicators. The prevalence of chronic kidney disease and the proportion of population resident in nursing homes were found to have the largest individual effect estimates. Strong spatial autocorrelation in COVID-19 mortality and considerable collinearity in COVID-19-associated health conditions were also detected. What do these findings mean? Our findings reiterate that differential risks of severe outcomes from COVID-19 across populations are dependent on the structures and contexts in which outbreaks occur. National and subnational socioeconomic indicators and burden of disease estimates can potentially be leveraged to allocate vaccines optimally and reduce severe outcomes from COVID-19.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1549-1277,1549-1676,,,,JUL,2021,18,7,,,,,,,e1003693,10.1371/journal.pmed.1003693,,,,,,,WOS:000673032200001,34255766,,,,,,,,
J,"Graichen, H",,,,"Graichen, Heiko",,,What is the difference between the first and the second/third wave of Covid-19? - German perspective,JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS,,,,,,,,,,,,"Now it has been more than 12 months since the first cases of the new Corona virus variant SARS Cov 2 have been detected in China. The first wave of the pandemic hit a lot of countries hard and many patients died. Not enough specialized equipment and limited knowledge of the disease added to the severity of this first phase. We all learned from our mistakes made during this first wave of the pandemic and due to that the confidence to be able to manage the second wave a lot better was high. Nevertheless, much higher infection numbers, more patients in ICUs and in some countries also more deaths were seen during the second wave. In this editorial we will describe the differences between the first and second wave from a European-German perspective and look at the impact it had on different parts of our lives. In general, some shortcomings were relatively easy to prevent from happening again. Basic equipment such as face masks, FFP2 masks and disinfectant is not an issue anymore. The respective political systems have solved that problem. Some countries also have learned from the first wave that prevention is the only option to reduce patient numbers hitting the hospitals and especially the ICUs. Due to those facts, most of the European countries now thought they could deal with higher infection numbers. This, however, was an erroneous belief. Theoretical constructs such as a Lockdown light have failed to prove successful. Finally, only a hard Lockdown can bring down numbers sufficiently. In Hospitals, the experience from the first wave helped to treat patients more effectively, leading to an improved infection number/death ratio. However, the political decision to react slow and sometimes only in increments and not with full force led to a huge increase in patient numbers and consecutively soaring numbers of cases needing treatment in hospitals and ICUs. While some countries managed this second wave a lot better than the first, Germany for example did not. Meanwhile more than 20 000 deaths compared to less than 10 000 in the entire first wave is a sure indication and it was certainly not caused by the medical performance in Hospitals being poorer the second time around. For Orthopaedic surgeons, the second wave led to the same restrictions as the first one. Again, they became part of the interdisciplinary COVID-19 teams on the wards and again, the numbers of elective surgeries plummeted dramatically. Financial consequences will remain throughout 2021. The second wave was a hard test for society, particularly as it hit its peak around Christmas time. Contact restrictions, closed hotels, forbidden fireworks at New Year all that is a challenge in particular for the younger people in the societies. All those restrictions, however, can never be an excuse for people delivering abstruse theories via social media or during demonstrations. Scientists all over the world deliver reliable information, these are the people to trust -they are the only experts. Some of them also successfully developed what we all hoped for - a vaccine. Although vaccination started some days back, it will take at least until autumn 2021 to have our normal lives back. Hopefully we all learned a lesson.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0972-978X,,,,,MAR-APR,2021,24,,,,,,A1,A3,,10.1016/j.jor.2021.01.011,,,,,,,WOS:000644179800001,33519131,,,,,,,,

COVID-19 forecasts have received much media attention, and numerous platforms have been created to inform the public. However, forecasting effectiveness varies by geographic scope and is affected by changing assumptions in behaviors and preventative measures in response to the pandemic. Due to time requirements for developing a COVID-19 vaccine, evidence is needed to inform short-term forecasting method selection at county, health district, and state levels. Objective: COVID-19 forecasts keep the public informed and contribute to public policy. As such, proper understanding of forecasting purposes and outcomes is needed to advance knowledge of health statistics for policy makers and the public. Using publicly available real-time data provided online, we aimed to evaluate the performance of seven forecasting methods utilized to forecast cumulative COVID-19 case counts. Forecasts were evaluated based on how well they forecast 1, 3, and 7 days forward when utilizing 1-, 3-, 7-, or all prior-day cumulative case counts during early virus onset. This study provides an objective evaluation of the forecasting methods to identify forecasting model assumptions that contribute to lower error in forecasting COVID-19 cumulative case growth. This information benefits professionals, decision makers, and the public relying on the data provided by short-term case count estimates at varied geographic levels. Methods: We created 1-, 3-, and 7-day forecasts at the county, health district, and state levels using (1) a naive approach, (2) Holt-Winters (HW) exponential smoothing, (3) a growth rate approach, (4) a moving average (MA) approach, (5) an autoregressive (AR) approach, (6) an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) approach, and (7) an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) approach. Forecasts relied on Virginia's 3464 historical county-level cumulative case counts from March 7 to April 22, 2020, as reported by The New York Times. Statistically significant results were identified using 95% CIs of median absolute error (MdAE) and median absolute percentage error (MdAPE) metrics of the resulting 216,698 forecasts. Results: The next-day MA forecast with 3-day look-back length obtained the lowest MdAE (median 0.67, 95% CI 0.49-0.84, P<.001) and statistically significantly differed from 39 out of 59 alternatives (66%) to 53 out of 59 alternatives (90%) at each geographic level at a significance level of .01. For short-range forecasting, methods assuming stationary means of prior days' counts outperformed methods with assumptions of weak stationarity or nonstationarity means. MdAPE results revealed statistically significant differences across geographic levels. Conclusions: For short-range COVID-19 cumulative case count forecasting at the county, health district, and state levels during early onset, the following were found: (1) the MA method was effective for forecasting 1-, 3-, and 7-day cumulative case counts; (2) exponential growth was not the best representation of case growth during early virus onset when the public was aware of the virus; and (3) geographic resolution was a factor in the selection of forecasting methods.",,,,"Lynch, Christopher/ABA-1054-2020","Lynch, Christopher/0000-0002-4830-7488; Gore, Ross/0000-0003-4065-6146",,,,,,,,,,,,1438-8871,,,,,MAR 23,2021,23,3,,,,,,,e24925,10.2196/24925,,,,,,,WOS:000636203600002,33621186,,,,,,,,

While the grant of patents is subject to establishing novelty and inventive step, it further indicates the technological development and is helpful for researchers working in the same technical domain. The aim of the present research work is to map the existing work through an analysis of patent literature in the field of Coronaviruses (CoV), particularly COVID-19 (2019-nCoV). CoV is a large family of viruses known to cause illness in humans and animals, particularly known for causing respiratory infections, as evidenced in earlier times, such as in MERS i.e., Middle East Respiratory Syndrome; and SRS i.e., Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. A recently identified novel-coronavirus, known as COVID-19, has caused pandemic situations across the globe. Objective: To expand the analysis of patents related to CoV and 2019-nCoV, an evaluation has been conducted by patenting trends of particular strains of identified CoV diseases by present legal status, main concerned countries via the earliest priority years and its assignee types and inventors of identified relevant patents. The global patent documents were analyzed to check the scope of claims along with focuses and trends of the published patent documents for the entire CoV family, including 2019-nCoV through the present landscape. Methods: To extract the results, the Derwent Innovation database was used by a combination of different keystrings. Approximately 3800 patents were obtained and further scrutinized and analyzed. The present write-up also discusses the recent progress of patent applications in a period of the year 2010 to 2020 (present) along with the recent developments in India for the treatment options for CoV and 2019-nCoV. Results: Present analysis showed that key areas of the inventions were the vaccines and diagnostic kits apart from the composition for the treatment of CoV. It was also observed that no specific vaccine treatments are available for the treatment of 2019-nCov; however, developing novel chemical or biological drugs and kits for early diagnosis, prevention, and disease management is the primary governing topic among the patented inventions. The present study also indicates potential research opportunities for the future, particularly to combat 2019-nCoV. Conclusion: The present paper analyzes the existing patents in the field of Coronaviruses and 2019-nCoV and suggests a way forward for the effective contribution in this upcoming research area. From the trend analysis, an increase in the filing of the overall trend of patent families was observed for a period of 2010 to the current year. This multifaceted analysis of identified patent literature provides an understanding of the focuses on present ongoing research and a grey area in terms of the trends of technological innovations in disease management in patients with CoV and 2019-nCoV. Furthermore, the findings and outcome of the present study offer insights for the proposed research and innovation opportunities and provide actionable information in order to facilitate policymakers, academia, research-driven institutes and also investors to make better decisions regarding programmed steps for research and development for the diagnosis, treatment and taking preventive measures for CoV and 2019-nCoV. The present article also emphasizes the need for future development and the role of academia and collaboration with industry for speedy research with a rationale.",,,,"University, Chitkara/AAZ-3040-2021","University, Chitkara/0000-0003-3776-7136; Nagpal, Manju/0000-0003-3503-6743",,,,,,,,,,,,1381-6128,1873-4286,,,,,2021,27,3,,,,,423,439,,10.2174/1381612826666200720233947,,,,,,,WOS:000620255800009,32693757,,,,,,,,

The present experimental study evaluated the effect of exposure to messages targeting cognitive attitude plus anticipated positive (pride) or negative (regret) affective reactions on intention to get vaccinated. Participants included 484 Italian adults randomly allocated to one of four conditions: 1) cognitive attitude message; 2) cognitive attitude plus positive affect message; 3) cognitive attitude plus negative affect message; 4) control condition (no message). Results showed that participants in the second condition reported greater intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19 compared with those in the control condition. Parallel mediation analysis indicated that the effect of the second condition on intention was fully mediated by cognitive attitude and anticipated positive affect.

Disparities in vaccine hesitancy between non-Hispanic Whites and minoritized groups have been observed, warranting exploration into the prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among Arab Americans. Methods Data from the Survey of Arab Health in America (SAHA) (n = 638), collected between May 2020 and September 2020, were analyzed to determine predictors for vaccine intention among Arab Americans. Chi-squared tests and logistic regression models were performed to determine the relationship between sociodemographic, immigration, acculturation, and COVID-19 risk variables and vaccine intention. Results More than half (56.7%) of respondents reported an intention to be vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine, 35.7% reported uncertainty, and 7.5% reported being unlikely to receive a vaccine. Of those unlikely to receive the vaccine, 72.9% were women and 85.4% reported moderate to high religiosity (p < 0.01).

Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted in 4 English databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library) and 4 Chinese databases (Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), the Chongqing VIP Chinese Science (VIP), Wanfang Database and China Biomedical Literature Database (CBM)) to collect the related studies. Quality evaluation was carried out for papers meeting the inclusion criteria using 6 items from the Downs and Black assessment checklist. The STATA statistical software version 15.1 was hired to perform meta-analysis. Results: Nine records with a total of 24,952 subjects were included in this meta-analysis. The results of this meta-analysis revealed that the pooled effect value of COVID-19 vaccination willingness among HCWs using a random-effects model was 51% (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41-0.62). Male, aged 30 years or older, having a history of prior influenza vaccination were facilitators for HCWs' intention to vaccinate against COVID19 (odds ratio (OR) 1.82, 95% CI 1.37-2.41, P = .000, I-2 = 59.4%; OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.16-1.51, P = .000, I-2 = 31.7%; OR 2.97, 95% CI 1.82-4.84, P = .000, I-2 = 88.1%). The impact of occupation on HCWs' intention to get vaccinated could not yet be definitively confirmed (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.69-1.06, P = .160, I-2 = 85.5%). Conclusion: COVID-19 vaccination acceptance of HCWs was at moderate level. Strengthening awareness of COVID-19 vaccine among HCWs, particularly female HCWs under 30 years who have no history of prior influenza vaccination, is crucial to eliminate concerns about vaccination and promote the application of COVID-19 vaccine in this population.

The RECIPE design is a union of factorial designs in which each of three attributes is presented alone, in pairs with each of the other attributes, and in a complete factorial with all other information. Consistent with previous research with analogous judgment tasks, the additive and relative weight averaging models with constant weights could be rejected in favor of a configural weight averaging model in which the lowest-valued attribute receives additional weight.

Study design: An online cross-sectional study was conducted among a representative sample of the French population between November 20th and 23rd 2020 (N = 1146). Methods: Factors associated with the intention to get vaccinated and with COVID-19 vaccine attitudes were estimated using ordered logistic and multinomial logistic regressions, respectively. Independent variables of interest include COVID-19 and vaccine perceptions, trust, endorsement of COVID-19 conspiracy theories and time/risk preferences. Results: Only 30.5% of our respondents would agree to get vaccinated against COVID-19 during the first semester of 2021 while 31.1% declare being unsure of their vaccination intentions. COVID-19 risk perceptions are associated with vaccination intentions and attitudes. Individual and collective benefits of the vaccine and the concerns over its safety are strongly associated with COVID-19 vaccination intentions and attitudes. Vaccine acceptors are more willing to take risks in the health domain compared with vaccine hesitant respondents which indicates that the COVID-19 vaccine is perceived as a greater health risk than the COVID-19 itself by some respondents. We also find a positive association between future preference and the willingness to get vaccinated. Conclusion: Awareness campaigns should be conducted to enhance vaccination uptake among vaccine hesitant individuals. These campaigns could highlight the positive benefit-risk balance of the COVID-19 vaccines or the short-term benefits of vaccination and should reinsure the public on the safety of the COVID-19 vaccines.

However, the challenge of vaccine hesitancy may lower the uptake rate and affect overall vaccine efficacy. Being a low-risk group in terms of serious consequences of infection, university students may possess low motivation to get vaccinated. Therefore, an expanded Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) incorporating perceived knowledge, adaptive response, and maladaptive response was proposed to investigate the COVID-19 vaccination intention among Taiwanese university students. University students (n = 924; 575 males; mean age = 25.29 years) completed an online survey during January to February 2021. The proposed expanded PMT model was examined using structural equation modeling (SEM). The results showed that perceived knowledge was significantly associated with coping appraisal (standardized coefficient (beta) = 0.820; p < 0.001), and coping appraisal was significantly associated with adaptive response (beta = 0.852; p < 0.001), maladaptive response (beta = 0.300; p < 0.001) and intention (beta = 0.533; p = 0.009).

This repeated cross-sectional study is based on a one-year investigation (spring 2020 to spring 2021) of intensive care physicians in one of the two COVID-19 hub hospitals in Central Italy and aims to study the evolution of the mental health status of intensivists during the pandemic. Changes in their work activity due to the pandemic were studied anonymously together with their perception of organisational justice, occupational stress, sleep quality, anxiety, depression, burnout, job satisfaction, happiness, and intention to quit. In May-June 2021, one year after the baseline, doctors reported an increased workload, isolation at work and in their social life, a lack of time for physical activity and meditation, and compassion fatigue. Stress was inversely associated with the perception of justice in safety procedures and directly correlated with work isolation. Occupational stress was significantly associated with anxiety, depression, burnout, dissatisfaction, and their intention to quit. Procedural justice was significantly associated with happiness. Doctors believed vaccinations would help control the problem; however, this positive attitude had not yet resulted in improved mental health.

In total, 161 caregivers of children with ADHD were recruited in this study. The caregivers completed an online questionnaire to provide data regarding their intention to vaccinate their children against COVID-19, concerns about the effectiveness and safety of vaccines, unfavorable family attitudes toward vaccines, and children's medication use for ADHD and comorbid psychopathology. The factors related to caregiver intentions to vaccinate their child were examined using linear regression analysis. The results indicated that 25.5% of caregivers were hesitant to vaccinate their children with ADHD, and 11.8% refused to vaccinate their children against COVID-19. The caregivers' concerns about the safety of vaccines and children's regular use of medication for ADHD were negatively associated with caregiver intentions to vaccinate, whereas the children's comorbid conduct or oppositional defiant problems were positively associated with the caregiver intentions to vaccinate.

Using the health beliefs model as a guide to our conceptual framework, we explore factors influencing vaccine hesitancy and health beliefs regarding risks and severity of the disease, along with individual variables such as income, age, religion, altruism, and collectivism. A questionnaire using newly created measures for various antecedents provided 4303 usable responses from Australia, Canada, England, New Zealand, and the United States. A factor analytic and structural equation model indicates that trust in vaccine approval, the perceived effectiveness of the vaccine for protecting others, and conspiracy beliefs are the most significant drivers of intentions to vaccinate. Older people, those seeking employment, and those who have received a recent influenza vaccine are more likely to be vaccinated against COVID-19.

This study analyses the factors associated with intent to vaccinate against COVID-19 in the Pakistani population. Methodology This cross-sectional, anonymous, online survey was carried out in April 2021. Participants' demographic details, experiences relating to COVID-19 and its vaccination, and their health beliefs were inquired and divided across Health Belief Model constructs. Multivariable regression was used to determine factors associated with a No/Not sure vs Yes response for vaccination intention. Results Of the 655 respondents, 62.0% were willing to get vaccinated. Significant predictors of a less likelihood of resisting vaccination included advanced age (AOR 0.25; 95% CI 0.07-0.88), fear of contracting COVID-19 (AOR 0.47; 95% CI 0.27-0.82), hope of preventing its spread (AOR 0.30; 95% CI 0.19-0.49), and community pressure (AOR 0.22; 95% CI 0.13-0.37). Concerns about vaccine reliability (AOR 2.75; 95% CI 1.67-4.53) and religious inhibitions (AOR 2.45; 95% CI 1.34-4.48) swayed people away from vaccination.

However, in recent surveys, acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine has been low. To design more effective outreach interventions, there is an urgent need to understand public perceptions of COVID-19 vaccines. Objective: Our objective was to analyze the potential of leveraging transfer learning to detect tweets containing opinions, attitudes, and behavioral intentions toward COVID-19 vaccines, and to explore temporal trends as well as automatically extract topics across a large number of tweets. Methods: We developed machine learning and transfer learning models to classify tweets, followed by temporal analysis and topic modeling on a dataset of COVID-19 vaccine-related tweets posted from November 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021. We used the F1 values as the primary outcome to compare the performance of machine learning and transfer learning models. The statistical values and P values from the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test were used to assess whether users' perceptions changed over time. The main topics in tweets were extracted by latent Dirichlet allocation analysis. Results: We collected 2,678,372 tweets related to COVID-19 vaccines from 841,978 unique users and annotated 5000 tweets. The F1 values of transfer learning models were 0.792 (95% CI 0.789-0.795), 0.578 (95% CI 0.572-0.584), and 0.614 (95% CI 0.606-0.622) for these three tasks, which significantly outperformed the machine learning models (logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machine). The prevalence of tweets containing attitudes and behavioral intentions varied significantly over time. Specifically, tweets containing positive behavioral intentions increased significantly in December 2020. In addition, we selected tweets in the following categories: positive attitudes, negative attitudes, positive behavioral intentions, and negative behavioral intentions. We then identified 10 main topics and relevant terms for each category. Conclusions: Overall, we provided a method to automatically analyze the public understanding of COVID-19 vaccines from real-time data in social media, which can be used to tailor educational programs and other interventions to effectively promote the public acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines.",,,,,"Li, Jili/0000-0002-7051-0503; Liu, Siru/0000-0002-5003-5354",,,,,,,,,,,,1438-8871,,,,,AUG 10,2021,23,8,,,,,,,e30251,10.2196/30251,,,,,,,WOS:000683837700006,34254942,,,,,,,,

People who tended to believe that the virus was artificially created felt powerless and were more concerned about the possible side-effects of the vaccines, which was negatively associated with their vaccination intention. The source of vaccine recommendation was found to be relevant to vaccination intention.

Methods: A nationwide online, cross-sectional survey was conducted in Qatar from 15th October 2020 to 15th November 2020 with voluntary participation open to all adult residents. Of the respondents, the population group for this study comprised the 341 pregnant and breastfeeding participants. The survey utilized a composite questionnaire incorporating a validated instrument to measure vaccine attitudes. The responses were recorded and analysed with statistical analysis being performed with SPSS software. Outcome measures included intentions towards vaccination and potential factors influencing vaccine hesitancy (contextual factors, vaccine specific concerns and group/individual influences). Results: Perinatal women exhibited a vaccine hesitancy rate of 25% towards COVID-19 immunisation. The main concerns of the group were of infection risks and main factor determining vaccine hesitancy was of vaccine specific safety concerns. Previous vaccine acceptors showed vaccine hesitancy to COVID-19 immunisation. A third of the group cited non availability of the vaccine as a concern. Conclusions: COVID-19 vaccine trials amongst pregnant and lactating women have lagged behind those for general populations and this has compounded concerns around safety in this special group. Perinatal women constitute a vulnerable group and play an important role in vaccination of wider family members.

Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among medical and nursing students aged > 18 years in their clinical years in Israel between 27 August and 28 September 2020. Hierarchical logistic regression was used to predict acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine. Results: A total number of 628 participants completed the survey. Medical students expressed higher intentions of getting vaccinated against COVID-19 than nursing students (88.1% vs. 76.2%, p < 0.01). The integrated model based on HBM and TPB was able to explain 66% of the variance (adjusted R-2' = 0.66). Participants were more likely to be willing to get vaccinated if they reported higher levels of perceived susceptibility, benefits, barriers, cues to action, attitude, self-efficacy and anticipated regret. Two interaction effects revealed that male nurses had a higher intention of getting vaccinated than did female nurses and that susceptibility is a predictor of the intention of getting vaccinated only among nurses. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that both models considered (i.e., HBM and TPB) are important for predicting the intention of getting a COVID-19 vaccine among medical and nursing students, and can help better guide intervention programs, based on components from both models. Our findings also highlight the importance of paying attention to a targeted group of female nurses, who expressed low vaccine acceptance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2076-393X,,,,JUL,2021,9,7,,,,,,,783,10.3390/vaccines9070783,,,,,,,WOS:000677150700001,34358199,,,,,,,,

Therefore, it is important to understand individuals' intention to get COVID-19 vaccinated. The present study applied the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) to explain the intention to get COVID-19 vaccinated among a representative sample in Qazvin, Iran. The TPB uses psychological constructs of attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control to explain an individual's intention to perform a behavior. Fear and perceived infectability were additionally incorporated into the TPB to explain the intention to get COVID-19 vaccinated. Utilizing multistage stratified cluster sampling, 10,843 participants (4092 males; 37.7%) with a mean age of 35.54 years (SD = 12.00) completed a survey. The survey assessed TPB constructs (including attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and intention related to COVID-19 vaccination) together with fear of COVID-19 and perceived COVID-19 infectability. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was performed to examine whether fear of COVID-19, perceived infectability, and the TPB constructs explained individuals' intention to get COVID-19 vaccinated. The SEM demonstrated satisfactory fit (comparative fit index = 0.970; Tucker-Lewis index = 0.962; root mean square error of approximation = 0.040; standardized root mean square residual = 0.050). Moreover, perceived behavioral control, subjective norm, attitude, and perceived COVID-19 infectability significantly explained individuals' intention to get COVID-19 vaccinated. Perceived COVID-19 infectability and TPB constructs were all significant mediators in the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and intention to get COVID-19 vaccinated. Incorporating fear of COVID-19 and perceived COVID-19 infectability effectively into the TPB explained Iranians' intention to get COVID-19 vaccinated.

Realising these benefits will depend in part upon the behavioural and social impacts of certification. The aim of this rapid review was to describe public attitudes towards certification, and its possible impact on uptake of testing and vaccination, protective behaviours, and crime. Method A search was undertaken in peer-reviewed databases, pre-print databases, and the grey literature, from 2000 to December 2020. Studies were included if they measured attitudes towards or behavioural consequences of health certificates based on one of three indices of Covid-19 status: test-negative result for current infectiousness, test-positive for antibodies conferring natural immunity, or vaccination(s) conferring immunity. Results Thirty-three papers met the inclusion criteria, only three of which were rated as low risk of bias. Public attitudes were generally favourable towards the use of immunity certificates for international travel, but unfavourable towards their use for access to work and other activities. A significant minority was strongly opposed to the use of certificates of immunity for any purpose. The limited evidence suggested that intention to get vaccinated varied with the activity enabled by certification or vaccination (e.g., international travel). Where vaccination is seen as compulsory this could lead to unwillingness to accept a subsequent vaccination. There was some evidence that restricting access to settings and activities to those with antibody test certificates may lead to deliberate exposure to infection in a minority. Behaviours that reduce transmission may decrease upon health certificates based on any of the three indices of Covid-19 status, including physical distancing and handwashing. Conclusions The limited evidence suggests that health certification in relation to COVID-19 - outside of the context of international travel - has the potential for harm as well as benefit. Realising the benefits while minimising the harms will require real-time evaluations allowing modifications to maximise the potential contribution of certification to enable safer access to a range of activities.",,,,"Drury, John/A-6479-2012","Drury, John/0000-0002-7748-5128; John, Ann/0000-0002-5657-6995; Kamal, Atiya/0000-0002-6651-6400; Marteau, Theresa/0000-0003-3025-1129; Mao, Guanlan/0000-0001-8148-6855",,,,,,,,,,,,,1471-2458,,,,JUN 24,2021,21,1,,,,,,,1205,10.1186/s12889-021-11166-0,,,,,,,WOS:000668571700001,34162364,,,,,,,,

To curb the spread of COVID-19, efficacious vaccination is emerging as essential in mitigating the disease and preventing deaths. Health care workers (HCW) are one of the first groups to receive vaccinations, so it is important to consider their attitudes to COVID-19 vaccination to better address barriers to widespread vaccination acceptance. This study aimed to evaluate variables that are linked with the recommendation of vaccines and intention to take-up vaccination against COVID-19 among the HCWs, in the context of the current pandemic. The study was conducted during the first week of the vaccination campaign dedicated to Italian HCWs, beginning in December 2020, and it involved all doctors in a public hospital in Sicily. The following questionnaires were administered: (1) The perceived vaccine trust questionnaire, measuring the degree of trust in vaccines by healthcare professionals both in general and for the protection of healthcare professionals themselves and patients; (2) the positive and negative affect scale-state (PANAS), for assessing positive and negative emotions in relation to their work as frontline care providers; (3) The locus of control of behaviour (LCB) to measure the extent to which subjects perceive responsibility for their personal behaviour (internal vs. external); (4) recommendation vaccines item, referring to the intention to recommend vaccination. The findings suggest that socio-demographic control variables (age, gender, and seniority) showed little or no predictive power in vaccine recommendation, while vaccine confidence, positive emotions, and internal locus of control were excellent predictors of vaccine recommendations by doctors. Younger doctors, both in age and experience, are more confident in vaccines and recommend them more frequently.

Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study during November-December 2020 among Lebanese adults from all Lebanese regions using a survey tool with closed-ended questions that included sociodemographic data and questions about vaccine hesitancy, knowledge, attitude, practice, and fear of COVID-19. We used the snowball technique to collect the data because of the COVID-19 imposed lockdown. Results Of the 579 participants, 21.4% were willing to receive the vaccine, 40.9% refused, and the remainder were unsure of their response. More vaccine hesitancy (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.06; 95% CI 1.03-1.09) was significantly associated with more odds of disagreeing/ strongly disagreeing on receiving the COVID-19 vaccine compared to being neutral. More vaccine hesitancy (aOR = 0.95; 95% CI 0.91-0.99), female gender compared to males (aOR = 0.53; 95% CI 0.32-0.87), and being married compared to single (aOR = 0.53; 95% CI 0.29-0.98) were significantly associated with lower odds of agreeing/strongly agreeing on receiving the COVID-19 vaccine compared to being neutral. Conclusion Overall, our findings revealed a high percentage of people (40%) who strongly disagreed with receiving the vaccine, mainly females, married participants, and those who have a general vaccine hesitancy. Moreover, no significant association was found with knowledge, attitude, or prevention practice regarding COVID-19.

Two studies investigated the effects of two possible restrictions affecting COVID-19 vaccination: the limitation of non-vaccination by mandates and the limitation of vaccination by scarce vaccine supply. In the first study, we compared reactance about mandatory and scarce vaccination scenarios and the moderating effect of vaccination intentions, employing a German quota-representative sample (N = 973). In the preregistered second study, we replicated effects with an American sample (N = 1394) and investigated the consequences of reactance on various behavioral intentions. Results revealed that reactance was stronger when a priori vaccination intentions were low and a mandate was introduced or when vaccination intentions were high and vaccines were scarce. In both cases, reactance increased intentions to take actions against the restriction. Further, reactance due to a mandate was positively associated with intentions to avoid the COVID-19 vaccination and an unrelated chickenpox vaccination; it was negatively associated with intentions to show protective behaviors limiting the spread of the coronavirus. Opposite intentions were observed when vaccination was scarce.

In recognition of the dramatic shift to life online during the COVID-19 pandemic to mitigate disease spread and the increasing threat of further pandemics, we examine the challenges and opportunities inherent in the use of social media data in infectious disease modelling with particular focus on their inclusion in compartmental models.",,,,,", Joanna/0000-0001-9618-1288",,,,,,,,,,,,0092-8240,1522-9602,,,,MAY,2021,83,5,,,,,,,57,10.1007/s11538-021-00895-3,,,,,,,WOS:000639104900002,33835296,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to evaluate potential predictors of both (1) engagement in behaviors aimed at reducing the spread of COVID-19 and (2) intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19. It was hypothesized that Health Belief Model (HBM) constructs would predict each outcome. Additionally, given the politicization of the pandemic in the US, HBM constructs were considered as possible mediators of a relationship between political party affiliation and each outcome. A total of 205 participants completed an online survey, and data from 186 were analyzed using linear and ordinal regressions. Findings indicate that greater perceived response efficacy predicted greater engagement in preventive behaviors and intention to get vaccinated. Other HBM constructs were not significant predictors of either outcome. Mediation analyses indicated that affiliation with the Republican Party predicted reduced engagement in preventive health behaviors and vaccination intention, although effects were fully and partially mediated by lower levels of response efficacy. Understanding the predictors of adherence to recommended strategies is essential to developing effective public health campaigns that address risk factors for non-adherence and target those least likely to adhere. Public health interventions aimed at reducing the spread of COVID-19 in the US should emphasize the efficacy of preventive behaviors and encourage public trust in the safety and efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccines, particularly among Republicans.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1354-8506,1465-3966,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1080/13548506.2021.1921229,,APR 2021,,,,,WOS:000648129300001,33906540,,,,,,,,

There is a need to identify empirically supported strategies to increase uptake, especially among young adults as this subpopulation has shown relatively poor adherence to physical distancing guidelines. Social norms estimates of peers' behavior and attitudes - are robust predictors of health behaviors and norms-based intervention strategies may increase COVID vaccine uptake, once available. This study examined the extent that vaccination intentions and attitudes were associated with estimated social norms as an initial proof-of-concept test. Method: In November of 2020, 647 undergraduate students (46.21% response rate) completed online surveys in which they reported intentions to get COVID and influenza vaccines, perceived importance of these vaccines for young adults, and estimated social norms regarding peers' vaccination behaviors and attitudes. Results: Students reported significantly greater intentions to get a COVID vaccine (91.64%) than an influenza vaccine (76.04%), and perceived COVID vaccination as significantly more important than influenza vaccination. The sample generally held strong intentions to receive a COVID vaccine and thought that doing so was of high importance, but participants, on average, perceived that other young adults would be less likely to be vaccinated and would not think vaccination was as important. Multiple regression models indicated that estimated social norms were positively associated with participants' own intentions and perceived importance of getting a COVID vaccine. Conclusions: These significant associations highlight the potential value in developing and testing norms-based intervention strategies, such as personalized normative feedback, to improve uptake of forthcoming COVID vaccines among young adults.

Vaccine hesitancy is a long-standing problem, but it has assumed great urgency due to the pandemic. By early 2021, the United Kingdom had the world's highest Covid-19 mortality per million of population. Our survey of a nationally representative sample of UK adults (N = 5,114) measured socio-demographics, social and political attitudes, media diet for getting news about Covid-19, and intention to use social media and personal messaging apps to encourage or discourage vaccination against Covid-19. Cluster analysis identified six distinct media diet groups: news avoiders, mainstream/official news samplers, super seekers, omnivores, the social media dependent, and the TV dependent. We assessed whether these media diets, together with key attitudes, including Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy, conspiracy mentality, and the news-finds-me attitude (meaning giving less priority to active monitoring of news and relying more on one's online networks of friends for information), predict the intention to encourage or discourage vaccination. Overall, super-seeker and omnivorous media diets are more likely than other media diets to be associated with the online encouragement of vaccination. Combinations of (a) news avoidance and high levels of the news-finds-me attitude and (b) social media dependence and high levels of conspiracy mentality are most likely to be associated with online discouragement of vaccination. In the direct statistical model, a TV-dependent media diet is more likely to be associated with online discouragement of vaccination, but the moderation model shows that a TV-dependent diet most strongly attenuates the relationship between vaccine hesitancy and discouraging vaccination. Our findings support public health communication based on four main methods. First, direct contact, through the post, workplace, or community structures, and through phone counseling via local health services, could reach the news avoiders. Second, TV public information advertisements should point to authoritative information sources, such as National Health Service (NHS) and other public health websites, which should then feature clear and simple ways for people to share material among their online social networks. Third, informative social media campaigns will provide super seekers with good resources to share, while also encouraging the social media dependent to browse away from social media platforms and visit reliable and authoritative online sources. Fourth, social media companies should expand and intensify their removal of vaccine disinformation and anti-vax accounts, and such efforts should be monitored by well-resourced, independent organizations.",,,,"; Lewandowsky, Stephan/H-5285-2014","VACCARI, CRISTIAN/0000-0003-0380-8921; Kaiser, Johannes/0000-0001-9888-2037; Ross, Andrew/0000-0001-8283-2692; Larkin, Michael/0000-0003-3304-7000; Innocenti, Stefania/0000-0001-7926-0961; Lewandowsky, Stephan/0000-0003-1655-2013",,,,,,,,,,,,2056-3051,,,,,APR,2021,7,2,,,,,,,2.05631E+16,10.1177/20563051211008817,,,,,,,WOS:000637736900001,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of the current study was to describe the attitudes of workers towards COVID-19 vaccination prior to vaccination rollout, with a view to informing strategies to promote vaccine uptake within this high-risk sector. Methods An online survey was sent via email to workers supporting adults with ID in Ontario, Canada, between January 21 and February 3, 2021 by agency leadership and union representatives. Results Three thousand and three hundred and seventy-one workers, representing approximately 11.2% of Ontario workers supporting adults with ID completed an online survey. Most reported that they were very likely (62%) or likely (20%) to get a COVID-19 vaccine (vaccination intent) although 18% reported they were less likely to do so (vaccination nonintent). Workers with vaccination nonintent were younger and were more likely to endorse the beliefs that (1) it will not benefit them or those around them, (2) it was not part of their job, (3) rapid development confers uncertainties and risks, and (4) they were scared of potential vaccine side effects.

The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to investigate the psychological and demographic-economic factors related to the uptake behavior of pneumococcal vaccination among the Chinese elderly by using an integrated model based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT), and knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP). The theoretical model was tested via structural equation modeling (SEM) with data collected from 516 Chinese older adults aged 60 years and older. Our results suggested that knowledge, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, attitude, and trust had a significant correlation with behavioral intention; behavioral intention and trust had a positive correlation with the uptake behavior, gender, and and education level and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exerted significant moderating effects.

We conducted a survey in November-December 2020 at two large, academic hospitals in Philadelphia to evaluate the intention of hospital employees to be vaccinated. Methods: The survey was sent electronically to all employees (clinical and nonclinical staff) at a children's hospital and an adult hospital. The survey was voluntary and confidential. Questions focused on plans to receive a COVID-19 vaccine when available, reasons why employees would/would not get vaccinated, when employees planned to be vaccinated, vaccine safety and efficacy features that would be acceptable, and past history of receipt of other vaccines by the employee and family. Responses were analyzed using univariate and multiple logistic regression methods. Results: A total of 12,034 hospital employees completed the survey (a 34.5% response rate). Overall, 63.7% of employees reported that they planned to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, 26.3% were unsure, and 10.0% did not plan to be vaccinated. Over 80% of those unsure or unwilling to be vaccinated expressed concerns about vaccine side effects and the vaccines' newness. In multivariable logistic regression, persons planning to take a COVID-19 vaccine were more likely to be older, male, more educated, Asian or White, up-to-date on vaccinations, without direct patient contact, and tested for COVID-19 in the past. No significant difference in intention to be vaccinated was found between those with higher versus lower levels of exposure to COVID-19 patients or the number of previous exposures to patients with COVID-19. Conclusions: While the majority of hospital employees are planning to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, many are unsure or not planning to do so. Further education of hospital employees about the safety, efficacy, and value of the currently available COVID-19 vaccines is critical to vaccine acceptance in this population. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in Slovenia in December 2020 to find out the attitudes of the population regarding COVID-19 vaccination and the factors that affect these attitudes. Based on 12,042 fully completed questionnaires, we find that higher intention to get vaccinated is associated with men, older respondents, physicians and medical students, respondents who got the influenza vaccination, those who knew someone who had gotten hospitalised or died from COVID-19 and those who have more trust in experts, institutions and vaccines. Nurses and technicians were less likely to get vaccinated. In answers to an open question, sceptics were split into those doubting the quality due to the rapid development of the vaccine and those that reported personal experiences with side effects of prior vaccinations.

Compensated participants were recruited from the U.S. through an internet survey panel of 2.5 million residents developed by a commercial survey firm. Recruitment was based on quota sampling to produce a U.S. Census-matched sample representative of the nation with regard to region of residence, sex, and age. Results: COVID-19 vaccination intentions were weak, with 14.8% of respondents being unlikely to get vaccinated and another 23.0% unsure. Intent to vaccinate was highest for men, older people, individuals who identified as white and non-Hispanic, the affluent and college-educated, Democrats, those who were married or partnered, people with pre-existing medical conditions, and those vaccinated against influenza during the 2019-2020 flu season. In a multiple linear regression, significant predictors of vaccination intent were general vaccine knowledge (beta = 0.311, p < .001), rejection of vaccine conspiracies (beta = -0.117, p = .003), perceived severity of COVID-19 (beta = 0.273, p < .001), influenza vaccine uptake (beta = 0.178, p < .001), having >= 5 pre-existing conditions (beta = 0.098, p = .003), being male (beta = 0.119, p < .001), household income of >= $120,000 (beta = 0.110, p = .004), identifying as a Democrat (beta = 0.075, p < .029), and not relying upon social media for virus information (beta = -0.090, p (002).

Our study aimed to evaluate the knowledge, attitude, and practice of oncologists in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on them. METHODS A cross-sectional study was conducted using a validated questionnaire disseminated to oncologists by SurveyMonkey. The tool had 42 questions that captured participants' knowledge, attitude, and practice; their experiences; and the pandemic's impact on various aspects of their lives. Participants from Middle East and North African countries, Brazil, and the Philippines completed the electronic survey between April 24 and May 15, 2020. RESULTS Of the 1,010 physicians who participated in the study, 54.75% were male and 64.95% were medical or clinical oncologists. The level of knowledge regarding the prevention and transmission of the virus was good in 52% of participants. The majority (92%) were worried about contracting the virus either extremely (30%) or mildly (62%), and 84.85% were worried about transmitting the virus to their families. Approximately 76.93% reported they would take the COVID 19 vaccine once available, with oncologists practicing in Brazil having the highest odds ratio of intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccine (odds ratio, 11.8, 95% CI, 5.96 to 23.38, P < .001). Participants reported a negative impact of the pandemic on relations with coworkers (15.84%), relations with family (27.84%), their emotional and mental well-being (48.51%), research productivity (34.26%), and financial income (52.28%). CONCLUSION The COVID-19 pandemic has adverse effects on various personal and professional aspects of oncologists' lives. Interventions should be implemented to mitigate the negative impact and prepare oncologists to manage future crises with more efficiency and resilience.

Sample characteristics were gathered, and the participants were classified according to the degree of COVID-19 risk based on the categories of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Participants' KAP toward COVID-19 were assessed, and two scores were calculated: knowledge score and practice score. The association between different sample characteristics and these scores was identified using binary logistical regressions. The participants' vaccination intention was evaluated and multinomial logistic regression was applied to identify the predictors of vaccination intention. Finally, the reasons behind the participants' vaccination refusal/hesitation were determined and categorized into different groups. Results: 1,144 participants were enrolled in the study (females = 66.5%). 30.4% of the participants were at high risk of COVID-19 complications, and 27.5% were at medium risk.

High protective practices were followed by many participants (median of practice score = 7 out of 10). 3.7% of participants were infected, and 6.4% suspected they were infected with the COVID-19 virus. 36.8% of the participants answered No when asked if they would take the vaccine once it becomes available, and 26.4% answered, Not sure. The main reasons for the participants' vaccination refusal or hesitancy were concerns regarding the use of vaccines and a lack of trust in them. Conclusion: Participants reported high refusal/hesitancy. Several barriers were identified, and efforts should be intensified to overcome these barriers.",,,,,"Al-Qerem, Walid/0000-0001-9831-7572",,,,,,,,,,,,,2296-2565,,,,FEB 10,2021,9,,,,,,,,632914,10.3389/fpubh.2021.632914,,,,,,,WOS:000620976400001,33643995,,,,,,,,

However, no study has been conducted on the knowledge, attitudes, acceptance, and determinates of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study was aimed to investigate the knowledge, attitudes, acceptance, and determinants of acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine among the adult population in Ethiopia. Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 492 study participants from March 1 to March 15, 2021. A multistage sampling technique was used to recruit study participants. Six skilled and qualified data collectors had participated to gather the data using a pretested structured-administered questionnaire. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated with the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine. P-value <0.05 was considered to indicate statistically significant association. Results: This study revealed that the level of good knowledge, positive attitude and intention to accept the COVID-19 vaccine were 74%, 44.7%, and 62.6%, respectively. Moreover, having an age >= 46 years with an adjusted odds ratio of 2.36 [95% CI, 1.09-5.39], attended secondary and above education adjusted odds ratio 2.59 [95% CI, 1.52-4.39], having a chronic disease adjusted odds ratio of 3.14 [95% CI, 1.21-8.14], and having good knowledge about COVID-19 vaccine adjusted odds ratio 2.59 [95% CI, 1.67-4.02] were significantly associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Conclusion: In this study, the level of good knowledge, positive attitude, and intention to accept the COVID-19 vaccine were 74%, 44.7%, and 62.6%, respectively. Thus, health education and communication from government sources are very crucial methods to alleviate the negative attitude of the COVID-19 vaccine.",,,,"Mose, Ayenew/AAZ-6731-2021","Mose, Ayenew/0000-0003-4353-7791",,,,,,,,,,,,1178-6973,,,,,,2021,14,,,,,,2015,2025,,10.2147/IDR.S312116,,,,,,,WOS:000658380500001,34103948,,,,,,,,

Seasonal influenza vaccines can reduce influenza-associated morbidity in healthcare settings, but despite mandatory influenza vaccination in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the vaccination uptake rate among HCPs is below expectations. This study investigated vaccination trends from 2017 to 2020 to identify factors affecting vaccination among HCPs during the COVID19 pandemic flu and subsequent seasons. Methods: Cross-sectional study among HCPs was conducted in January 2021. A structured questionnaire was shared via social media. Vaccine uptake predictors were identified using descriptive statistics and logistic regression models (p-value 0.05). Results: A total of 424 HCPs (118 physicians and 306 nurses) completed the questionnaire. Vaccine uptake increased from 2017 to 2019 (45% to 52% to 62%) but fell (to 59%) during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic flu season. Multivariable analysis indicated participants >40 years old (AOR 3.09, 95% CI 1.64-5.83), female (AOR 1.74, 95% CI 1.13-2.67), non-Saudi (AOR 2.62, 95% CI 1.72-4.01), nurses (AOR 2.70, 95% CI 1.75-4.17), and who possessed accurate knowledge of the flu vaccine efficacy duration (AOR 3.04, 95% CI 1.87-4.94) were more likely to have received the vaccine. However, 79% of HCPs declared their intention to be vaccinated in the 2021 flu season, with participants >40 years old, female (AOR 2.25, 95% CI 1.38-3.68), non-Saudi (AOR 3.79, 95% CI 2.34-6.16), or nurses (AOR 2.94, 95% CI 1.82-4.76) more likely to do so. Conclusion: Influenza vaccination uptake declined among HCPs during the 2020 flu season compared with the previous season but is expected to increase in the upcoming 2021 season. Nevertheless, the findings are encouraging and indicate increased willingness of HCPs to become vaccinated in the upcoming 2021 season, but coverage could be further increased by policymakers via a comprehensive plan focusing particularly on younger HCPs, Saudis, males, and physicians.",,,,,"Khalil, Dr Rehana/0000-0001-6064-1537",,,,,,,,,,,,1178-2390,,,,,,2021,14,,,,,,2527,2536,,10.2147/JMDH.S330029,,,,,,,WOS:000696994400002,34552331,,,,,,,,

This study explored various factors influencing the COVID-19 vaccination intention and the applicability of the health belief model (HBM) to explore vaccination intention among the population of Saudi Arabia. Methods: This is an online survey conducted between January 6, 2021, and January 19, 2021, using a Google (TM) form questionnaire among Saudi population. The questionnaire aimed to assess the factors that influence the intent to receive the vaccine, by evaluating demographic details, COVID-19 experience and health self-assessment, acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination and preferences and health belief regarding COVID-19 illness and vaccination. Results: The survey generated a total of 1333 responses from all over the 13 provinces of the Kingdom. The participants had mixed perceptions regarding the susceptibility and severity of COVID-19. A total of 959 (71.9%) subjects responded positively to COVID-19 vaccine intent. Those with >15,000 SR per month income, no past exposure to COVID-19, and comorbidities reported significantly higher intention to take vaccination (p<0.05). Among the HBM variables, the perceived susceptibility construct (OR=3.82, 95% CI 1.64-8.94) and perceived benefit construct (OR=7.59, CI 1.65-34.86) were important facilitators for a definite intention to vaccinate. The perceived barriers construct (safety [OR= 0.062, CI 0.03-0.15]; side effects of the vaccine [OR=0.31, CI 0.13-0.75]) and cues to action construct (OR=0.32, CI 0.13-0.77) were the significant factors hindering the uptake of COVID-19 vaccine. However, the perceived severity construct did not play an important role in predicting definite intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccine in the Saudi population.

As dental education was significantly influenced by the novel coronavirus pandemic, this study aims to investigate preclinical dental students' perspectives on the implementation of remote education and school closure due to COVID-19 pandemic, self-reported effectiveness of on-line learning as well as their educational and personal experiences. Method. A self-administered questionnaire was posted online to a total of 258 out of 516 second and third-year preclinical dental students in Dec 2020/Jan 2021 at Faculty of Dental Medicine, Medical University-Sofia, Bulgaria. Survey items focused on 3 general domains: student attitude, assessment, and concerns regarding online learning; student current knowledge and perceptions of COVID-19 pandemic and student opinion of pandemic psychological impact on public health, personal experiences and intention for vaccination. Findings. One-hundred and sixty-nine students responded to the survey (response rate 65.5%). Most of them (70.4%) approved suspension of face-to-face classes due to the COVID-19 crisis. Eighty percent expressed dissatisfaction toward online teaching sessions and agreed that this will have negative effects on their education. Fifty-eight percent did not find remote education more stressful than in-person training. More concerns were expressed about financial issues than mental health problems. Intention for getting vaccinated was expressed by 53.3% and 40.8% thought that the vaccine would cause many side health effects. Implications for research and practice. Within the limitations of the study, identified gaps in online education could help increase effectiveness of learning environment and create opportunity to enhance education for the future.

Globally, several vaccines have been produced to be effective against COVID-19. This survey aimed to assess the demand and intent towards the COVID-19 vaccine among the general population in Ethiopia. Also, factors influencing their demand, intention, and willingness to pay for the COVID-19 vaccine were described, which is poorly understood in resource-limited settings. Methods: Subjects were 1160 individuals who completed an online questionnaire from February to March 2021. The study used the health belief model (HBM) to evaluate participants' intention to receive and willingness to pay (WTP) regarding the COVID-19 vaccine. Chi-square and binary logistic regression were conducted to identify the prevalence and associated factors of demand and WTP. Multinomial regression was done to examine the intent to receive a vaccine. Results: In total 1116 responses were collected. The results indicated a moderate level of demand and WTP among participants (64.7% and 56.0%, respectively). Further, the researchers examined participants' readiness towards COVID-19 vaccination, where 46.6% of participants had a definite intent, and close to half of the participants are unsure (32.8%) or unwilling (20.7%) to get vaccinated. Among other factors, items under perceived susceptibility and perceived benefits constructs in the HBM have been associated with participants' demand, willingness to vaccinate, and WTP. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the usefulness of the HBM model in evaluating the demand, intention, and willingness of participants to pay for COVID-19. Improving public awareness of the vulnerability should be a major point of attention to reduce the barriers, and improve demand and intention for COVID-19.

An online survey of Canadians' knowledge, attitudes, and practices",UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO MEDICAL JOURNAL,,,,,,,,,,,,"Background: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has spread across 188 countries and claimed over 300,000 lives so far. Despite strong public health messaging and strict community restrictions in Canada, misconceptions and high-risk behaviours such as mass public gatherings have contributed to its spread across the country. Local data on the knowledge, attitudes, and practices from high-case areas could inform public health messaging during the current unprecedented pandemic. Study Objective: To collate and describe the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of highly affected Canadian communities related to the COVID-19 pandemic and to evaluate factors associated with risky behaviours in order to inform public health policies and communication. Methods and Study Design: Information on COVID-19 knowledge, attitudes, and practices was collected via online convenience sampling from 1,593 Canadians between 6 to 26 April, 2020. The high outbreak provinces of Alberta and Ontario were targeted. Findings: While knowledge of COVID-19 transmission and prevention was high (mean knowledge score of 10.5/12 (88%)), a significant minority of respondents (32%) expressed at least one attitude resistant to public messaging that could hamper containment efforts: visiting crowded places other than grocery stores or pharmacies, close encounters with non-household members, and intention not to isolate if having mild flu symptoms, or known COVID-19 exposure. Factors associated with these risky behaviours included low COVID-19 knowledge (OR 1.2 (95% CI 1.1-1.3), p=0.0057), feeling not worried (OR 2.9 (95% CI 2.2-3.9), p<0.001), and feeling uninformed about the pandemic (OR 1.6 (95% CI 1.1-2.3), p=0.030). Respondents reported high acceptance of a potential vaccine (93%) and endorsed a wide-spread vaccination strategy (81%). Interpretation: Low levels of knowledge and worry regarding COVID-19 may be key contributors to resistance against public health messaging.

The behavioral economic methodology could be used to inform future public health vaccination campaigns designed to influence public perceptions and improve public acceptance of the vaccine. In June 2020, 534 respondents completed online validated behavioral economic procedures adapted to evaluate COVID-19 vaccine demand in relation to a hypothetical development process and efficacy. An exponential demand function was used to describe the proportion of participants accepting the vaccine at each efficacy. Linear mixed effect models evaluated development process and individual characteristic effects on minimum required vaccine efficacy required for vaccine acceptance. The rapid development process scenario increased the rate of decline in acceptance with reductions in efficacy. At 50% efficacy, 68.8% of respondents would seek the standard vaccine, and 58.8% would seek the rapid developed vaccine. Rapid vaccine development increased the minimum required efficacy for vaccine acceptance by over 9 percentage points, gamma = 9.36, p < 0.001.

To that end, on a sample of Italian citizens, we implemented a path model to test the impact of health engagement on the willingness to vaccinate against SARS-CoV-2, and whether this relationship is direct or mediated by the general attitude towards vaccines and the risk perception. Moreover, we tested the configural and weak invariance of the model across gender and three age groups. Results show that health engagement is positively related to the intention to vaccinate and that this relationship is partially mediated by the general attitude towards vaccines.

We found that a considerable proportion of the public in China has a definite intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccine; a higher proportion expressed a probable intention. Perceived benefits and barriers to vaccination (namely vaccine efficacy and adverse event concerns) of the health belief model constructs were significant predictors of COVID-19 vaccination intent. A substantial proportion was concerned about fake or faulty COVID-19 vaccines; however, this was not a significant predictor of vaccination intention. The willingness-to-pay for the COVID-19 was determined and was found to be positively associated with income. Higher confidence in domestically-made COVID-19 vaccines was also found in this study. The preference for domestically-made over foreign-made COVID-19 vaccines indicates that a future COVID-19 vaccine developed by domestic companies will receive a favourable response from the public in China.The findings of this study provide useful guidance for tailored interventions to enhance the acceptance of a new COVID-19 vaccine once it is available. Promotional messages framing the benefit of vaccination and concerns about new vaccine safety to enhance vaccine uptake is warranted. Background This study attempts to understand coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine demand and hesitancy by assessing the public's vaccination intention and willingness-to-pay (WTP). Confidence in COVID-19 vaccines produced in China and preference for domestically-made or foreign-made vaccines was also investigated. Methods A nationwide cross-sectional, self-administered online survey was conducted on 1-19 May 2020. The health belief model (HBM) was used as a theoretical framework for understanding COVID-19 vaccination intent and WTP. Results A total of 3,541 complete responses were received. The majority reported a probably yes intent (54.6%), followed by a definite yes intent (28.7%). The perception that vaccination decreases the chances of getting COVID-19 under the perceived benefit construct (OR = 3.14, 95% CI 2.05-4.83) and not being concerned about the efficacy of new COVID-19 vaccines under the perceived barriers construct (OR = 1.65, 95% CI 1.31-2.09) were found to have the highest significant odds of a definite intention to take the COVID-19 vaccine. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) of WTP for COVID-19 vaccine was CNY yen 200/US$28 (IQR CNY yen 100-500/USD$14-72). The highest marginal WTP for the vaccine was influenced by socio-economic factors. The majority were confident (48.7%) and completely confident (46.1%) in domestically-made COVID-19 vaccine. 64.2% reported a preference for a domestically-made over foreign-made COVID-19 vaccine. Conclusions The findings demonstrate the utility of HBM constructs in understanding COVID-19 vaccination intent and WTP.

In a quantitative survey with a representative sample of U.S. adults, study 2 (N = 1656) tested the psychological determinants of intention to get vaccinated. Results revealed (1) the most common attitudinal, normative, and control beliefs about COVID-19 vaccination; (2) instrumental attitude as the strongest determinant of COVID-19 vaccination intention; and (3) 'achieving peace of mind' as an effective target for health promotion efforts.

We conducted two cross-sectional studies examining the relationship between COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs, vaccine attitudes, and the intention to be vaccinated against COVID-19 when a vaccine becomes available. We also examined how these beliefs predicted support for a controversial medical treatment, namely, chloroquine. In an exploratory study 1 (N= 409), two subdimensions of COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs were associated with negative attitudes toward vaccine science. These results were partly replicated and extended in a pre-registered study 2 (N= 396). Moreover, we found that COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs (among which, conspiracy beliefs about chloroquine), as well as a conspiracy mentality (i.e., predisposition to believe in conspiracy theories) negatively predicted participants' intentions to be vaccinated against COVID-19 in the future. Lastly, conspiracy beliefs predicted support for chloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19. Interestingly, none of the conspiracy beliefs referred to the dangers of the vaccines.

The strategy relies on several vaccination activities, including preventive mass vaccination campaigns (PMVCs). However, to what extent PMVCs are associated with a decreased risk of outbreak has not yet been quantified. Methods and findings We used the self-controlled case series (SCCS) method to assess the association between the occurrence of yellow fever outbreaks and the implementation of PMVCs at the province level in the African endemic region. As all time-invariant confounders are implicitly controlled for in the SCCS method, this method is an alternative to classical cohort or case-control study designs when the risk of residual confounding is high, in particular confounding by indication. The locations and dates of outbreaks were identified from international epidemiological records, and information on PMVCs was provided by coordinators of vaccination activities and international funders. The study sample consisted of provinces that were both affected by an outbreak and targeted for a PMVC between 2005 and 2018. We compared the incidence of outbreaks before and after the implementation of a PMVC. The sensitivity of our estimates to a range of assumptions was explored, and the results of the SCCS method were compared to those obtained through a retrospective cohort study design. We further derived the number of yellow fever outbreaks that have been prevented by PMVCs. The study sample consisted of 33 provinces from 11 African countries. Among these, the first outbreak occurred during the pre-PMVC period in 26 (79%) provinces, and during the post-PMVC period in 7 (21%) provinces. At the province level, the post-PMVC period was associated with an 86% reduction (95% CI 66% to 94%, p < 0.001) in the risk of outbreak as compared to the pre-PMVC period. This negative association between exposure to PMVCs and outbreak was robustly observed across a range of sensitivity analyses, especially when using quantitative estimates of vaccination coverage as an alternative exposure measure, or when varying the observation period. In contrast, the results of the cohort-style analyses were highly sensitive to the choice of covariates included in the model. Based on the SCCS results, we estimated that PMVCs were associated with a 34% (95% CI 22% to 45%) reduction in the number of outbreaks in Africa from 2005 to 2018. A limitation of our study is the fact that it does not account for potential time-varying confounders, such as changing environmental drivers of yellow fever and possibly improved disease surveillance. Conclusions In this study, we provide new empirical evidence of the high preventive impact of PMVCs on yellow fever outbreaks. This study illustrates that the SCCS method can be advantageously applied at the population level in order to evaluate a public health intervention. Author summary Why was this study done? Yellow fever is a mosquito-borne, vaccine-preventable disease that may cause large urban outbreaks, especially in tropical African regions. Since 2006, preventive mass vaccination campaigns (PMVCs) have been implemented in many African provinces. These are large-scale vaccination campaigns targeting all or most age groups in a specific area. The preventive impact PMVCs may have on the risk of yellow fever outbreak has not been quantified yet. What did the researchers do and find? We used the self-controlled case series (SCCS) method to assess the association between PMVCs and outbreak risk at the province level in 34 African countries between 2005 and 2018. We compared pre- and post-PMVC periods within each province individually, thus implicitly controlling for all possible confounders that do not vary in time, especially the fact that provinces indicated for PMVCs are generally those considered at highest baseline risk of yellow fever (confounding by indication). At the province level, we estimated that implementation of PMVCs was associated with an 86% reduction (95% CI 66% to 94%) in the risk of yellow fever outbreak. A complete cohort analysis provided less reliable results than the SCCS method, likely because of confounding by indication that was not entirely controlled for by adjusting for known drivers of yellow fever. We further estimated that all PMVCs conducted between 2006 and 2018 in Africa may have reduced the total number of yellow fever outbreaks by 34% (95% CI 22% to 45%). What do these findings mean? These results provide new empirical evidence of the high preventive impact of PMVCs on yellow fever outbreaks. These results may encourage rapid rescheduling of yellow fever PMVCs that have been postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The SCCS design may be advantageously applied at the population level to assess the impact of public health interventions.",,,,"Jean, Kevin/ABA-6355-2020; Whitaker, Heather/O-4995-2017","Jean, Kevin/0000-0001-6462-7185; Hamlet, Arran/0000-0003-0871-0640; Mengistu, Tewodaj/0000-0003-3475-3599; Gaythorpe, Katy/0000-0003-3734-9081; Whitaker, Heather/0000-0001-5833-1863",,,,,,,,,,,,1549-1277,1549-1676,,,,FEB,2021,18,2,,,,,,,e1003523,10.1371/journal.pmed.1003523,,,,,,,WOS:000619269800001,33600451,,,,,,,,

However, no experimental research has sought to intervene on this variable to develop a scalable response to the COVID-19 infodemic. Objective: Our study examined whether brief exposure to an infographic about the scientific process might increase trust in science and thereby affect belief in misinformation and intention to take preventive actions for COVID-19. Methods: This two-arm, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial aimed to recruit a US representative sample of 1000 adults by age, race/ethnicity, and gender using the Prolific platform. Participants were randomly assigned to view either an intervention infographic about the scientific process or a control infographic. The intervention infographic was designed through a separate pilot study. Primary outcomes were trust in science, COVID-19 narrative belief profile, and COVID-19 preventive behavioral intentions. We also collected 12 covariates and incorporated them into all analyses. All outcomes were collected using web-based assessment. Results: From January 22, 2021 to January 24, 2021, 1017 participants completed the study. The intervention slightly improved trust in science (difference-in-difference 0.03, SE 0.01, t(1000)=2.16, P=.031). No direct intervention effect was observed on belief profile membership, but there was some evidence of an indirect intervention effect mediated by trust in science (adjusted odds ratio 1.06, SE 0.03, 95% CI 1.00-1.12, z=2.01, P=.045) on membership in the scientific profile compared with the others. No direct nor indirect effects on preventive behaviors were observed. Conclusions: Briefly viewing an infographic about science appeared to cause a small aggregate increase in trust in science, which may have, in turn, reduced the believability of COVID-19 misinformation.

The results show that for those with low perceived risk of COVID-19, messages about potential negative consequences to others (e.g., family, friends, community members) from one's failure to get vaccinated led to message elaboration and favorable attitude toward vaccination, which in turn promoted one's intention to get vaccinated.

The present study incorporated fear of COVID-19 and perceived infectability with the theory of planned behavior (TPB) to form an expanded TPB to analyze factors affecting Pakistani young adults' intentions to uptake the COVID-vaccine in Pakistan. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted and recruited participants from Pakistani social media users. The proposed extended TPB model was examined by using structural equation modeling. Results A total of 1034 individuals replied to the survey. The three factors of the original theory of planned behavior and the fear of COVID-19 were positively related to their intention to uptake COVID-19 vaccination (r = 0.25-0.66). Moreover, the perceived infectability positively influenced the three theories of planned behavioral factors and the fear of COVID-19 (r = 0.27-0.60), also affecting the participants' intentions to uptake COVID-19 vaccination. Conclusions Perceived infectability was positively related to the participants' intentions to uptake COVID-19 vaccination, and perceived behavioral control was the strongest mediator.

Without a specific treatment, vaccination became the main strategy against COVID-19. In this study, we determined the rate and factors associated with the willingness to get vaccinated against COVID-19 among slum residents and their main reasons associated with the vaccine intention. The study was conducted in Pau da Lima, a slum community in Salvador Brazil. In total, 985 residents were interviewed. Among them 66.0% (650/985) were willing to get vaccinated, 26.1% (257/985) were hesitant to take the vaccine and 7.9% (78/285) were not sure. The main reasons cited for vaccine hesitancy or being unsure were concerns about vaccine efficacy and potential side effects. In contrast, the main reasons cited for wanting the vaccine were the high incidence of COVID-19 cases and participants' self-perception of their own health history. Multivariate analysis identified that COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was associated with younger age and low social capital, summarized as low perceived importance of vaccination to protect one's family, friends and community.

S. Findings reveal multidimensional determinants of vaccination intentions involving confidence, complacency, and circumspection factors. Using descriptive analyses and multilevel mixed-effects regression models, we find persistent partisan divide across states and significant racial disparities, with Blacks more likely to develop vaccine hesitancy due to confidence and circumspection than Whites. Vaccine hesitancy among Blacks declines dramatically across time but varies little across states, indicating new directions to effectively address inequalities in vaccination. Results also show nuanced gender differences, with women more likely to develop hesitancy due to circumspection and men more likely to have hesitancy due to complacency.

Moreover, the deep and pervasive history of medical racism in the U.S. has created a context in which some racial and ethnic groups exhibit greater levels of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy; yet few researchers have attempted to determine whether these patterns persist with time. The purpose of this study was twofold: (a.) assess the role of time in COVID-19 vaccine intentions from April 2020 to January 2021, and (b.) examine whether race and ethnicity shape COVID-19 vaccine intention trajectories. Data were drawn from 9 waves of the Understanding America Study (n = 5023), a national probability panel study of U.S. adults. Multilevel logistic regression models were used to assess overall COVID-19 vaccine intention trajectories and trajectories by race and ethnicity. Results demonstrate intentions to get a COVID-19 vaccine significantly decreased from April 2020 to November 2020, but by January 2021, intentions to get a COVID-19 vaccine slightly increased. Findings also show trajectories significantly differed by racial and ethnic background. Asian/Pacific Islanders had the highest probability of likely getting a COVID-19 vaccine at baseline, followed by Whites and Latina/os. Black Americans exhibited the lowest probability of likely getting vaccinated, and, in most cases, the gap between Black Americans and other racial groups grew over time. Key findings from this study demonstrate that, among U.S. adults, time and race and ethnicity play significant roles in COVID-19 vaccine intentions. Understanding the role of time and race and racism in shaping COVID-19 vaccine intention trajectories can help government agencies and public health experts tasked with administrating vaccines better understand disparities in vaccine uptake.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2352-8273,,,,,SEP,2021,15,,,,,,,,100824,10.1016/j.ssmph.2021.100824,,,,,,,WOS:000697998100007,,,,,,,,,

Methods From 2 April to 30 April 2021, we conducted an online, international survey of adults with systemic rheumatic disease who received COVID-19 vaccination. We collected patient-reported data on clinician communication, beliefs and intent about discontinuing disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) around the time of vaccination, and patient-reported adverse events after vaccination. Results We analysed 2860 adults with systemic rheumatic diseases who received COVID-19 vaccination (mean age 55.3 years, 86.7% female, 86.3% white). Types of COVID-19 vaccines were Pfizer-BioNTech (53.2%), Oxford/AstraZeneca (22.6%), Moderna (21.3%), Janssen/Johnson & Johnson (1.7%) and others (1.2%). The most common rheumatic disease was rheumatoid arthritis (42.3%), and 81.2% of respondents were on a DMARD. The majority (81.9%) reported communicating with clinicians about vaccination. Most (66.9%) were willing to temporarily discontinue DMARDs to improve vaccine efficacy, although many (44.3%) were concerned about rheumatic disease flares. After vaccination, the most reported patient-reported adverse events were fatigue/somnolence (33.4%), headache (27.7%), muscle/joint pains (22.8%) and fever/chills (19.9%). Rheumatic disease flares that required medication changes occurred in 4.6%. Conclusion Among adults with systemic rheumatic disease who received COVID-19 vaccination, patient-reported adverse events were typical of those reported in the general population.

Predictors were identified to be associated with vaccination intention based on the health belief model framework. Thirty-eight articles, with 81,173 individuals, were included. The pooled COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rate was 73.31% (95%CI: 70.52, 76.01). Studies using representative samples reported a rate of 73.16%.

Methods: We surveyed 2328 Taiwanese from July 29 to August 6, 2020, assessing demographics, information sources, and preventive behaviors during the 2003 SARS outbreaks, 2009 pandemic influenza H1N1, COVID-19, and with post-survey intentions. Characteristics associated with the practice of preventive behaviors in 2020 were identified through logistic regression. Results: Preventive behaviors were conscientiously practiced by 70.2% of participants. Compared with 2003 SARS/2009 H1N1, the percentages of facemask use (66.6% vs 99.2% [indoors], P < 0.001) and onperson AHH (44.2% vs 65.4% [hand sanitizers], P < 0.001) significantly increasedduring 2020 COVID-19. Highest adherence to preventive behaviors in 2020 was among females (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.72), those receiving government COVID-19 information (aOR, 1.52), participants recruited from primary-care clinics (aOR, 1.43), and those who practiced AHH during 2003 SARS/2009 H1N1 (aOR, 1.37). Conclusions: Government leadership, healthcare providers risk communication, and public cooperation rapidly mitigated the spread of COVID-19 in Taiwan even before vaccination. Future global efforts must implement such population-based preventive behaviors at a level above the viral-transmissionthreshold, particularly in areas with fast-spreading SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Though the Pakistani government has successfully implemented robust policies to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic; however, studies assessing public intention to get COVID-19 vaccination (IGCV) are limited. The aim of this study is to deal with this literature gap and has also expanded the conceptual framework of planned behaviour theory. We have introduced three new considerations (risk perceptions of the pandemic, perceived benefits of the vaccine, and unavailability of vaccine) to have a better understanding of the influencing factors that encourage or discourage public IGCV. Methods Results are based on a sample collected from 754 households using an inclusive questionnaire survey. Hypotheses are tested by utilizing the structural equation modelling approach. Results The results disclose that the intention factors, that is, attitude, risk perceptions of the pandemic, and perceived benefits of the vaccine, impart positive effects on public IGCV. In contrast, the cost of the vaccine and the unavailability of the vaccine have negative effects. Notably, environmental concern has an insignificant effect.

Using cognitive dissonance as a guide, the current study's aim was to increase compliance with coronavirus safety measures, such as social distancing, wearing masks, and getting vaccinated. In Phase 1, participants experienced dissonance by advocating consistent adherence to safety protocols and recalling instances when they did not follow them.

Analyses included adjusted logistic regressions (aOR). A total of 1,911 adults completed the survey from December 2020 to February 2021. Results: Overall, 76.2% were females, 33.7% were aged 50 or older, and 82.7% reported an intent to get vaccinated. Individuals who did not perceive that their chances of getting COVID-19 were high (aOR = 2.94; 95%CI = 2.24-3.86), that getting COVID-19 was not a possibility for them (aOR = 2.86; 95%CI = 2.19-3.74), or unafraid of getting COVID-19 (aOR = 3.80; 95%CI = 2.76-5.23) had higher odds of uncertainty and unwillingness to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Participants who perceived that COVID-19 complications were not serious also had higher odds of uncertainty and unwillingness (aOR = 7.50; 95%CI = 3.94-14.3), whereas those who did not perceive that they would get very sick with COVID-19 had 89% increased odds. Those who agreed that they would only take the vaccine if many individuals took it had higher odds of uncertainty and unwillingness (aOR = 3.32; 95%CI = 2.49-4.43).

Variables such as trust in authorities, risk perception of COVID-19 infection, vaccine efficacy, current or previous influenza vaccination, and vaccine safety affected vaccine acceptance. Globally, in March 2020, the average vaccine acceptance observed was 86% which dropped to 54% in July 2020 which later increased to 72% in September 2020. Globally, the average rate of vaccine hesitancy in April 2020 was 21%, which increased to 36% in July 2020 and later declined to 16% in October 2020.

Additionally, the purpose is to detect misinformation and extremism, not only to help online social networks (OSN) to target such content more rapidly but also to provide a close to real-time picture of trending topics, misinformation, and extremism flowing on OSN. This could help authorities to identify the intents behind them and find out how and when they should address such content. Design/methodology/approach This study focuses on extracting and verifying knowledge from large-scale OSN data, at the intersection of the Coronavirus pandemic and the US 2020 presidential election. More specifically, this study makes manual, statistical and automatic inferences and extracts knowledge from over a million Tweets related to the two aforementioned major events. On the other hand, disinformation operations intensified in 2020 with the coincidence of the Coronavirus pandemic and presidential election. This study applies machine learning to detect misinformation and extreme opinions on OSN. Over one million Tweets have been collected by our server in real-time from the beginning of April 2020 to the end of January 2021, using six keywords, namely, Covid, Corona, Trump, Biden, Democrats and Republicans. These Tweets are inspected with regard to their topics, opinions, news, and political affiliation, along with misinformation and extremism. Findings Our analyses showed that the majority of these Tweets concern death tolls, testing, mask, drugs, vaccine, and travel bans. The second concern among these Tweets is reopening the economy and schools, unemployment, and stimulus bills. The third concern is related to the Coronavirus pandemic's impacts on politics, voting, and misinformation. This highlights the topics that US voters on Twitter were most concerned about during this time period, among the multitude of other topics that politicians and news media were reporting or discussing. Automatic classification of these Tweets using a long short-term memory network revealed that Tweets containing misinformation formed between 0.5% and 1.1% of Coronavirus-related Tweets every month and Tweets containing extreme opinions formed between 0.5% and 3.1% of them every month, with its pick in October 2020, coinciding with the US presidential election month. Originality/value The originality of this study lies in establishing a framework to collect, process, and classify OSN data to detect misinformation and extremism and to provide a close to real-time picture of trending topics, misinformation, and extremism flowing on OSN.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1477-996X,1758-8871,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1108/JICES-04-2021-0039,,AUG 2021,,,,,WOS:000685284700001,,,,,,,,,

Immunization programs appeared to be the only effective strategy to end the pandemic which is achieved when there are high rates of acceptance and coverage. To achieve that, it is important to realize Saudis' concept and risk perceptions about COVID-19, and acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine. Aim: to assess public willingness and preparedness with their attitude to receive COVID-19 vaccine in Saudi Arabia. Methodology: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted targeting all available population in Saudi Arabia. Data were collected from participants using pre-structured electronic questionnaire. The questionnaire included the following data: participants socio-demographic data information regarding covid-19 experience and infection among participants. The last section covered items of participants' intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Results: The study included 2,227 participants whose ages ranged from 18 to 62 years old with mean age of 31.7 +/- 11.3 years old. Exactly 70.2% of the participants were females and 48.4% were single. Exactly 26.2% had chronic health problems. About 60% of the participants reported their agreement to have the covid-19 vaccine if available. The most reported causes for refusing taking the vaccine for those who refused, were fear of side effects (66.7%), followed by fear of safety issue (49.4%), and fear of efficacy issue (32.4%). More than half (57.3%) of the respondents agreed that Vaccination is a good idea because it makes them feel less anxious about getting COVID-19 infection. Also, 60.4% agreed that vaccination reduces my chances of catching COVID-19 or its complications. Conclusions: In conclusion, the study revealed that acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine in Saudi Arabia is somewhat good but not sufficient to have the recommended herd immunity.

Development of a wider range of vaccines, with different mechanisms of action, could help control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 globally. We developed a protein subunit vaccine against COVID-19 using a dimeric form of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as the antigen. We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of this vaccine, ZF2001, and determine the appropriate dose and schedule for an efficacy study. Methods We did two randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1 and phase 2 trials. Phase 1 was done at two university hospitals in Chongqing and Beijing, China, and phase 2 was done at the Hunan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Xiangtan, China. Healthy adults aged 18-59 years, without a history of SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 infection, an RT-PCR-positive test result for SARS-CoV-2, a history of contact with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases, and severe allergies to any component of the vaccine were eligible for enrolment. In phase 1, participants were randomly assigned (2:2:1) to receive three doses of the vaccine (25 mu g or 50 mu g) or placebo intramuscularly, 30 days apart. In phase 2, participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1:1:1) to receive the vaccine (25 mu g or 50 mu g) or placebo intramuscularly, 30 days apart, in either a two-dose schedule or a three-dose schedule. Investigators, participants, and the laboratory team were masked to group allocation. For phase 1, the primary outcome was safety, measured by the occurrence of adverse events and serious adverse events. For phase 2, the primary outcome was safety and immunogenicity (the seroconversion rate and the magnitude, in geometric mean titres [GMTs], of SARS-CoV-2-neutralising antibodies). Analyses were done on an intention-to-treat and per-protocol basis. These trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04445194 and NCT04466085) and participant follow-up is ongoing. Findings Between June 22 and July 3, 2020, 50 participants were enrolled into the phase 1 trial and randomly assigned to receive three doses of placebo (n=10), the 25 mu g vaccine (n=20), or the 50 mu g vaccine (n=20). The mean age of participants was 32.6 (SD 9.4) years. Between July 12 and July 17, 2020, 900 participants were enrolled into the phase 2 trial and randomly assigned to receive two doses of placebo (n=150), 25 mu g vaccine (n=150), or 50 mu g vaccine (n=150), or three doses of placebo (n=150), 25 mu g vaccine (n=150), or 50 mu g vaccine (n=150). The mean age of participants was 43.5 (SD 9.2) years. In both phase 1 and phase 2, adverse events reported within 30 days after vaccination were mild or moderate (grade 1 or 2) in most cases (phase 1: six [60%] of ten participants in the placebo group, 14 [70%] of 20 in the 25 mu g group, and 18 [90%] of 20 in the 50 mu g group; phase 2: 37 [25%] of 150 in the two-dose placebo group, 43 [29%] of 150 in the two-dose 25 mu g group, 50 [33%] of 150 in the two-dose 50 mu g group, 47 [31%] of 150 in the three-dose placebo group, 72 [48%] of 150 in the three-dose 25 mu g group, and 65 [43%] of 150 in the three-dose 50 mu g group). In phase 1, two (10%) grade 3 or worse adverse events were reported in the 50 mu g group. In phase 2, grade 3 or worse adverse events were reported by 18 participants (four [3%] in the two-dose 25 mu g vaccine group, two [1%] in the two-dose 50 mu g vaccine group, two [1%] in the three-dose placebo group, four [3%] in the three-dose 25 mu g vaccine group, and six [4%] in the three-dose 50 mu g vaccine group), and 11 were considered vaccine related (two [1%] in the two-dose 25 mu g vaccine group, one [1%] in the two-dose 50 mu g vaccine group, one [1%] in the three-dose placebo group, two [1%] in the three-dose 25 mu g vaccine group, and five [3%] in the three-dose 50 mu g vaccine group); seven participants reported serious adverse events (one [1%] in the two-dose 25 mu g vaccine group, one [1%] in the two-dose 50 mu g vaccine group, two [1%] in the three-dose placebo group, one [1%] in the three-dose 25 mu g vaccine group, and two [1%] in the three-dose 50 mu g vaccine group), but none was considered vaccine related. In phase 2, on the two-dose schedule, seroconversion rates of neutralising antibodies 14 days after the second dose were 76% (114 of 150 participants) in the 25 mu g group and 72% (108 of 150) in the 50 mu g group; on the three-dose schedule, seroconversion rates of neutralising antibodies 14 days after the third dose were 97% (143 of 148 participants) in the 25 mu g group and 93% (138 of 148) in the 50 mu g group. In the two-dose groups in phase 2, the SARS-CoV-2-neutralising GMTs 14 days after the second dose were 17.7 (95% CI 13.6-23.1) in the 25 mu g group and 14.1 (10.8-18.3) in the 50 mu g group. In the three-dose groups in phase 2, the SARS-CoV-2-neutralising GMTs 14 days after the third dose were 102.5 (95% CI 81.8-128.5) in the 25 mu g group and 69.1 (53.0-90.0) in the 50 mu g group. Interpretation The protein subunit vaccine ZF2001 appears to be well tolerated and immunogenic. The safety and immunogenicity data from the phase 1 and 2 trials support the use of the 25 mu g dose in a three-dose schedule in an ongoing phase 3 trial for large-scale evaluation of ZF2001's safety and efficacy.

As a result, testing for COVID-19 is still considered a vital method to contain infection. For testing to be effective, barriers towards testing intention need to be investigated; and available literature on the challenges are scarce. This study aimed to investigate barriers of COVID-19 testing among a sample of Jordanian adults and predict testing intention within the context of these barriers. Methods A cross-sectional, descriptive, and predictive design was employed in this study among a sample of 1074 Jordanian adults. Results Three clusters of barriers predicted testing intention; perceived discrimination at work, concerns of individual's privacy, and having negative feelings towards testing. While perceived discrimination at work and privacy concerns were negatively associated with individuals' intention for testing, experiencing negative feelings towards COVID-19 testing was a positive predictor.

The pandemic presented new barriers to pediatric vaccinations. Furthermore, the development of COVID-19 vaccines has complicated factors underlying vaccine hesitancy. We performed a cross-sectional mobile phone-based survey at Children's Hospital Los Angeles querying parents regarding perspectives on vaccines before and during the pandemic. Our primary aim was to understand the impact of the pandemic on routine childhood vaccine hesitancy. Secondarily, we examined intent to vaccinate, COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, and key contributing demographic factors. Among 252 participants, we found overall increased childhood vaccine hesitancy (p=0.006), increased risk perception (p=0.006), and unchanged vaccine confidence during the COVID-19 pandemic. Increased hesitancy did not translate into decreased intent to vaccinate with routine childhood vaccines or influenza vaccines. During the pandemic, households with higher income (50-99 K, >100 K) correlated with decreased routine childhood vaccine hesitancy, while Hispanic ethnicity and African American race had increased risk perception. For COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, households with higher income (>100 K) correlated with decreased hesitancy, while non-White ethnicity and race had increased risk perception. We found that routine childhood vaccine hesitancy increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, mainly due to increased risk perception. Key contributing demographic factors behind both childhood vaccine hesitancy and COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy included household income and race. Understanding factors behind routine childhood vaccine hesitancy is crucial to maintaining pediatric vaccination rates and promoting vaccine confidence during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0094-5145,1573-3610,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s10900-021-01017-9,,JUL 2021,,,,,WOS:000676074800001,34297272,,,,,,,,

We investigate the role of socioeconomic and demographic factors as well as exposure to COVID-19. Among the 5,018 participants, 24.0% reported their intention to refuse the vaccine. Thinking this vaccine would not be safe, being against vaccination in general, and perceiving COVID-19 to be harmless were the three main reasons given to explain vaccine refusal. Women were more likely to refuse the vaccine, especially due to a reluctance toward vaccination in general or the perception that a COVID-19 vaccine would not be safe. Some factors associated with the intention to refuse the vaccine were the same among men and women such as a lack of prior vaccination against influenza, and concern over being infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), while others differed slightly according to gender such as age, and high prevalence of COVID-19 in their region of residence.

Associations between pandemic worry, vaccination intention, and HBM were ascertained using correlation and mediation analyses. Individuals with chronic illness reported a higher level of pandemic worry, higher levels of perceived threat, greater benefits from vaccination, had lower self-efficacy and bought more medicine and sanitary/hygienic products. No significant differences were observed regarding vaccination intention, barriers against vaccination, and changes in food buying behavior. We found that the relationship between pandemic worry and vaccination intention was partially mediated by the perceived threat of disease and the benefits of vaccination. Pandemic worry predicted vaccination intention directly but also through the contribution of the perceived threat of disease and the benefits of vaccination. These findings suggest that presenting evidence of COVID-19 vaccine efficacy and the benefits of having the vaccine (especially for vulnerable groups, such as chronic illness patients) will encourage the population to follow vaccination recommendations.",,,,"Iacob, Claudia I./AAS-2978-2020","Iacob, Claudia I./0000-0001-9508-4881",,,,,,,,,,,,1664-1078,,,,,JUL 12,2021,12,,,,,,,,674018,10.3389/fpsyg.2021.674018,,,,,,,WOS:000678339800001,34322062,,,,,,,,

A successful response to the COVID-19 pandemic requires achieving high levels of vaccine uptake. We tested whether directly contrasting the high efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines with the lower efficacy of the annual flu vaccine would increase intentions to take a COVID-19 vaccine. Design. A pre-registered online study of 481 participants compared four information conditions: (1) no information; (2) COVID-19 Vaccine Information Only; and COVID-19 Vaccine Information combined with flu vaccine information suggesting either (3) 60% efficacy or (4) 40% efficacy; we measured COVID-19 and flu vaccine intentions along with several other vaccine-related variables. Methods. The Prolific platform was used to recruit 481 UK participants (64% female; aged between 18 and 85 years) who had been pre-screened to have intermediate levels of vaccine hesitancy. After reading a short text (similar to 200 words) about COVID-19 vaccines, participants were asked about their vaccination intentions. Results. Providing information about the safety and efficacy of the new COVID-19 vaccines resulted in vaccination intentions that were, on average, 0.39 standard deviations (SDs) higher than those in the no information condition; providing the same COVID vaccine efficacy information in the context of information about flu vaccine efficacy resulted in a further significant increase in vaccination intentions that were 0.68 SD higher than those in the no information condition. This positive contrast effect for the COVID-19 vaccine was not associated with reduced flu vaccine intentions. Conclusions. Vaccination intentions can be strengthened through a simple messaging intervention that utilizes context effects to increase perceived response efficacy.",,,,,"Davis, Colin/0000-0001-5814-5104",,,,,,,,,,,,1359-107X,2044-8287,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1111/bjhp.12546,,JUL 2021,,,,,WOS:000671789500001,34250684,,,,,,,,

However, the success of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign relies on high uptake by the public. We monitored Quebecers' attitudes and intention toward COVID-19 vaccination during the first and second waves of the pandemic. Since March 2020, online surveys are conducted every week in Quebec (Canada) to assess Quebecers' adherence to recommended public health measures (3,300 respondents are surveyed every week through an online panel; respondents are not invited to answer the survey for 21 days after responding). Ten items measured respondents' attitudes and intentions regarding COVID-19 vaccination. Logistic regression models were used to identify determinants of intention to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Intention to be vaccinated against COVID-19 ranged from 76%-66% between the first and second waves. The proportion of undecided adults remained stable (12%). Being a man; being 60 years of age and over; having a university education level; having or living with someone with chronic medical conditions and increased risk perceptions of COVID-19 were the strongest predictors of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in multivariate analysis. During data collection, COVID-19 vaccine supply was very limited. It was reassuring to note that intention to be vaccinated is the highest among older age groups that are prioritized to be vaccinated first. As more doses and vaccines will be available it will be important to enhance vaccine acceptance and uptake, especially among adults younger than 60 years of age and Quebecers with lower risk perceptions of COVID-19.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2164-5515,2164-554X,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1080/21645515.2021.1947096,,JUL 2021,,,,,WOS:000671980800001,34236949,,,,,,,,

Approximately 39% of the participants expressed vaccine hesitancy, and 29.8% and 24% felt highly vulnerable to contracting COVID-19 and seasonal influenza, respectively. The majority (59.5%) were willing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, although only 31.7% were willing to receive the flu vaccine.

Scientists from worldwide have been successful in developing the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, but COVID-19 vaccination faces several challenges which may impact its success. Methodology: A cross-sectional study was done to determine the beliefs and perceptions of people on COVID-19 vaccination in Delhi in the month of March-April 2021 with the help of a questionnaire which was distributed online. It contained 22 questions and was finalized after the review through a pilot study and content validation. Statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel 2007. Results: A total of 286 participants were analyzed, of which 55% were female. The mean age was 33.4 years. Intention of people for taking vaccination was analyzed with relation to different age groups, and positive trend was seen in people with advancing age and it was also statistically significant (P = 0.002). It was seen that people with higher education and of higher socioeconomic status were more inclined to get vaccination; however, in our study, 39.1% of the participants were concerned about the safety of the vaccine. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that despite repeated assurance about the safety of vaccine, people still had doubts and misconceptions which were evident from our study.

In this study, we tested the extended TPB to predict university students' intentions to uptake COVID-19 vaccination. Methods: An online cross-sectional survey was developed to investigate students' intention to uptake the COVID-19 vaccine based on the components of the TPB (i.e., attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control) and extended components (i.e., knowledge about COVID-19, risk perception of COVID-19, and past influenza vaccination behavior).

We used Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to investigate the interrelationship between COVID-19 vaccination intention and perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived self-efficacy, and perceived response efficacy. Results SEM showed that perceived severity to COVID-19 (beta = .17, p < .001), perceived self-efficacy about receiving the COVID-19 vaccine (beta = .26, p < .001), and the perceived response efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine (beta = .70, p < .001) were significant predictors of vaccination intention. PMT accounted for 61.5% of the variance in intention to COVID-19 vaccination, and perceived response efficacy was the strongest predictor of COVID-19 vaccination intention.

Vaccine hesitancy has increased during recent years, and more research is needed on its situational determinants. This paper reports a preregistered experiment (N = 654) that examined whether communicating descriptive social norms - information about what most people do - is an effective way of influencing young people's intentions and reducing their hesitancy to take the COVID-19 vaccine. We found weak support for our main hypothesis that conveying strong (compared to weak) norms leads to reduced hesitancy and stronger intentions. Furthermore, norms did not produce significantly different effects compared to standard vaccine information from the authorities. Moreover, no support was found for the hypothesis that young people are more strongly influenced by norms when the norm reference group consists of other young individuals rather than people in general. These findings suggest that the practical usefulness of signaling descriptive norms is rather limited, and may not be more effective than standard appeals in the quest of encouraging young adults to trust and accept a new vaccine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1041-0236,1532-7027,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1080/10410236.2021.1937832,,JUN 2021,,,,,WOS:000660951500001,34114897,,,,,,,,

However, the effectiveness of any vaccine is dictated by the proportion of the population willing to be vaccinated. This observational population-based study examines intentions to be vaccinated against COVID-19 throughout the pandemic. Methods: In November 2020, longitudinal data from a nationally representative sample of 7,547 U.S. adults enrolled in the Understanding America Study were analyzed using multinomial logistic regression. Participants reported being willing, undecided, and unwilling to get vaccinated against COVID-19 across 13 assessments conducted from April to October 2020. Public attitudes to vaccination against COVID-19 were also assessed on a 4-point Likert-type scale. Results: Willingness to vaccinate declined from 71% in April to 53.6% in October. This was explained by an increase in the percentage of participants undecided about vaccinating (from 10.5% to 14.4%) and the proportion of the sample unwilling to vaccinate (from 18.5% to 32%). The population subgroups most likely to be undecided/unwilling to vaccinate were those without a degree (undecided: RR=2.47, 95% CI=2.04, 3.00; unwilling: RR=1.92, 95% CI=1.67, 2.20), Black participants (undecided: RR=2.18, 95% CI=1.73, 2.74; unwilling: RR=1.98, 95% CI=1.63, 2.42), and female participants (undecided: RR=1.41, 95% CI=1.20, 1.65; unwilling: RR=1.29, 95% CI=1.14, 1.46). Participants who were older or were on higher incomes were least likely to be undecided or unwilling to vaccinate. Concerns about potential side effects of a vaccine were common. Conclusions: Intentions to be vaccinated against COVID-19 have declined rapidly during the pandemic, and close to half of Americans are undecided or unwilling to be vaccinated.

Methodology: This cross-sectional study was conducted in all eight divisions of Bangladesh. Data from 7,357 adult respondents were collected between January 17 and February 2, 2021, using a self-administered semi-structured questionnaire. Statistical software STATA (Version 16.1) was used for all analyses. Results: The majority of study participants were from the Dhaka division (34.24%).

This year in view of COVID-19 pandemic, attitudes of HCWs towards vaccination are particularly important. A cross-sectional study was completed to understand how to best encourage and facilitate the vaccination of HCWs based on the previous years' findings. Methods An online survey was disseminated to all hospital staff via electronic channels. The clinical audit sphinx software was used for data collection and analysis. Results The total number of responses was n = 728, almost double the rate from 2018 (N = 393). A total of 78% (N = 551) of participants were vaccinated last year. A total of 94% (N = 677) of participants reported their intention to be vaccinated this year. The main barriers listed were being unable to find time (32%, N = 36), side effects (30%, N = 33) and thinking that it does not work (21%, N = 23). The most popular suggestions for how to increase uptake were more mobile immunisation clinics (72%, N = 517) and more information on the vaccine (50%, N = 360). A total of 82% of participants (N = 590) agreed that healthcare workers should be vaccinated, with 56% (N = 405) agreeing that it should be mandatory. Of the participants who were not vaccinated last year (N = 159), 40% (N = 63) agreed that COVID-19 had changed their opinion on influenza immunisation with a further 11% (N = 18) strongly agreeing.

Objective: We conducted a theory-based content analysis based on the capability, opportunity, motivation-behavior (COM-B) model to characterize the factors influencing behavioral intentions toward COVID-19 vaccines mentioned on the Twitter platform. Methods: We collected tweets posted in English from November 1-22, 2020, using a combination of relevant keywords and hashtags. After excluding retweets, we randomly selected 5000 tweets for manual coding and content analysis. We performed a content analysis informed by the adapted COM-B model. Results: Of the 5000 COVID-19 vaccine-related tweets that were coded, 4796 (95.9%) were posted by unique users. A total of 97 tweets carried positive behavioral intent, while 182 tweets contained negative behavioral intent. Of these, 28 tweets were mapped to capability factors, 155 tweets were related to motivation, 23 tweets were related to opportunities, and 74 tweets did not contain any useful information about the reasons for their behavioral intentions (K=0.73). Some tweets mentioned two or more constructs at the same time. Tweets that were mapped to capability (P<.001), motivation (P<.001), and opportunity (P=.03) factors were more likely to indicate negative behavioral intentions.

Influenza vaccine uptake has remained low in most countries, including Switzerland. The aim of the study was to determine parents' intentions towards influenza vaccination of their children, as well as themselves, and to assess regional differences. METHODS: Parents presenting to four paediatric emergency departments (Zurich, Bern, Bellinzona, Geneva) were asked to complete an online survey during and after the first lockdown of the COVID-19 pandemic (April to June 2020). The anonymised survey included demographic information, vaccination history and intentions to vaccinate against influenza, as well as attitudes towards future vaccination against COVID-19. RESULTS: The majority of children (92%; 602/654) were up-to-date on their vaccination schedule. In 2019/2020, 7.2% (47/654) were vaccinated against influenza. Children with chronic illnesses were more frequently vaccinated than healthy children (19.2% vs 5.6%; p = 0.002). For the coming winter season, 111 (17%) parents stated they plan to vaccinate their children against influenza, more than double the rate from last year, and 383 (59.2%) parents suggested they will vaccinate against COVID-19 once a vaccine is available. Regional differences between German and Latin Switzerland were found for parents' intent to have their children vaccinated against influenza next season (Zurich and Bern 14.3%, Bellinzona and Geneva 27.2%, p<0.001), but not for a hypothetical vaccination against COVID-19 (Zurich and Bern 59.1%, Bellinzona and Geneva 59.7%, p = 0.894). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a substantial increase of parents' intention to vaccinate their children against influenza, especially in hard-hit Latin Switzerland. The Swiss government and public health organisations can leverage these regional results to promote influenza vaccination among children for the coming seasons.",,,,,"Seiler, Michelle/0000-0002-1263-5818",,,,,,,,,,,,1424-7860,1424-3997,,,,MAY 12,2021,151,,,,,,,,w20508,10.4414/smw.2021.20508,,,,,,,WOS:000653520300003,34002802,,,,,,,,

This research will begin to examine the relative influence of relevant psychological, social, and situational factors on intent to engage with a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine among key workers and non-key workers. Design Cross-sectional. Methods The study utilized a sample of UK adults who completed the 1-month follow-up of The COVID-19 Psychological Wellbeing Study during April/May 2020 and indicated having not been previously diagnosed with COVID-19 (key workers n = 584; not key workers n = 1,021). These groups were compared in relation to their intentions to vaccinate, perceived risk of infection, and symptom severity. Binary logistic regression was used to examine predictors of vaccine hesitancy. Results Overall, 74.2% of the sample (76.2% key workers, 73.1% non-key workers) indicated they would accept a COVID-19 vaccine in future. Key workers (in particular health and social care workers) had a higher perceived risk of becoming infected in the coming months. For key workers, being female and perceiving oneself as having relatively low infection risk in the next 6 months was associated with increased likelihood of vaccine hesitancy. For non-key workers, however, being aged 25-54, having a low or average income and not knowing someone diagnosed with COVID-19 were associated with hesitancy.

The aim of this study was to explore anxiety levels among adults and children in the UAE and to identify potential risk and protective factors for well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Using a web-based cross-sectional survey we collected data from 2200 self-selected, assessed volunteers and their children. Demographic information, knowledge and beliefs about COVID-19, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) using the (GAD-7) scale, emotional problems in children using the strengths and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ), worry and fear about COVID-19, coping mechanisms and general health information were collected. Descriptive analysis was carried out to summarize demographic and participant characteristics, Chi-square analysis to explore associations between categorical variables and anxiety levels and multivariable binary logistic regression analysis to determine predictors of anxiety levels in adults and emotional problems in children. Results The overall prevalence of GAD in the general population was 71% with younger people (59.8%) and females (51.7%) reporting highest levels of anxiety. Parents who were teachers reported the highest percentage of emotional problems in children (26.7%). Adjusted multivariable logistic regression for GAD-7 scores showed that being female, high levels of worry associated with COVID-19, intention to take the COVID-19 vaccine and smoking were associated with higher levels of anxiety. Adjusted multivariable logistic regression for SDQ showed that higher emotional problems were reported for children in lower and higher secondary education, and parents who had severe anxiety were seven times more likely to report emotional problems in their children.

However, the rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines has led to concern about their safety and thus to public vaccine hesitancy. Strategic heath communication channels, which are widely used and highly trusted, can contribute to more effective promotions of vaccination intention and to the reduction of misleading information about COVID-19 vaccines. Therefore, this study examines the relationship between the exposure to and credibility of different health information sources and the COVID-19 vaccination intention among 629 German adults. Descriptive statistical analysis and multiple linear regressions are employed to examine the research questions. Results reveal that, aside from reliable information from experts and health authorities, local newspapers also have a positive impact on COVID-19 vaccination intention. However, this effect diminishes to some extent when age is considered. In addition, alternative information sources pose a noticeable threat to COVID-19 vaccination intention.

Hence this research study seeks to identify critical factors influencing Indian people's attitudes and intentions to take up Covid-19 vaccinations. Methods: An online questionnaire was administered to a sample (n = 254) drawn from Indian population, to assess the impact of perceived benefits, risk perceptions, social media exposure, social norms, and trust associated with Covid-19 vaccines on people's attitudes towards Covid-19 vaccines and their intentions to take up the Covid-19 vaccinations. Results: The findings showed that the perceived benefits, social norms, and trust correlated significantly with people's attitudes towards Covid-19 vaccinations. In contrast, risk perceptions and social media exposure showed an insignificant influence on people's attitudes towards Covid-19 vaccinations. Social norms, trust, and people's attitudes towards the Covid-19 vaccinations are significantly correlated with their intentions to take up Covid-19 vaccinations. On the contrary, social media exposure was found to have an insignificant influence on people's intentions to take up Covid-19 vaccinations. Conclusion: Participants' intentions to take up Covid-19 vaccinations was influenced mainly by their attitudes and perceptions of Covid-19 vaccines in general, which strongly confirms the importance of various dimensions (perceived benefits, trust, social norms) of Covid-19 vaccines in cultivating Covid-19 vaccination acceptance among participants'.

Sixteen percent of respondents believed that COVID-19 is a hoax, and 17% believed that COVID-19 was intentionally created by humans. Seven percent of the variance of the hoax theory and 10% of the variance of the creation theory was explained by (in descending order of relevance) low cognitive reflection, low digital health literacy, high experience with dissociation and, to some extent, high bullshit receptivity. Belief in COVID-related conspiracy theories depended less on psychological and cognitive variables compared to conspiracy mentality (16% of the variance explained). The effect of digital health literacy on belief in COVID-related theories was moderated by cognitive reflection.

Three vaccines have been approved in the United States (USA). However, there is still some hesitancy in COVID-19 vaccine acceptability among some subgroups, including college students. While research is limited on vaccine acceptability behavior among college students, preliminary data suggests hesitancy as being high. This study aimed to explain the correlates of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among college students who reported hesitancy toward the COVID-19 vaccine and those who did not using the initiation component of the multi-theory model (MTM) of health behavior change. Using a cross-sectional study design, data were collected from a Southern USA University (n = 282) utilizing a valid and reliable 27-item questionnaire in February and March 2021. Almost half (47.5%) of participants reported hesitancy to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. The three constructs of MTM's initiation model, behavioral confidence (b = 0.089, p < 0.001), participatory dialogue (b = 0.056, p < 0.001), and changes in the physical environment (b = 0.066, p = 0.001) were significantly associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among those who were not hesitant to take the vaccine and accounted for 54.8% of the variance. Among those who were hesitant to take the COVID-19 vaccine, the MTM construct of behavioral confidence (b = 0.022, p < 0.001) was significant along with Republican Party political affiliation (b = -0.464, p = 0.004), which was negatively associated with vaccine acceptance. The model accounted for 60.6% of the variance in intention to take the COVID-19 vaccine. This study provides evidence for the utility of MTM as a timely intervention to design messages for college students to enhance COVID-19 vaccine acceptability.",,,,,"Sharma, Manoj/0000-0002-4624-2414; Wilkerson, Amanda/0000-0002-5116-9012",,,,,,,,,,,,,1660-4601,,,,MAY,2021,18,9,,,,,,,4617,10.3390/ijerph18094617,,,,,,,WOS:000650267100001,33925327,,,,,,,,

Patients & Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted using an online questionnaire between July 2020 and August 2020 that captured demographic data, risk perception; trust in government and public health authorities and willingness to accept a future COVID-19 vaccine. Data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Science and Chi-square and logistic regression at a 95% confidence interval calculated. Appropriate institutional ethical board approval and informed consent obtained from all participants were obtained. Results: 1,228 responses were received over the study period. The mean age of respondents was 32.8 years (SD 10.4), 12.7% (156/1,228) were health workers, and 66.9% (820/1,228) had tertiary level of education. Intention to accept a future COVID-19 vaccine was expressed by 50.2% (617/1,228). Older age, male gender, trust in government, trust in public health authorities, confidence in vaccine developers, willingness to pay for and travel for a vaccine, and vaccination during an outbreak were significantly associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Healthcare workers and respondents with pre-existing medical conditions were not significantly different from non-healthcare workers and persons without medical conditions respectively with regards to the willingness to be vaccinated. Conclusion: One in 2 persons would accept a COVID-19 vaccine when one becomes available in the country.

We determined the prevalence of COVID-19 vaccination intention (VI) and fear of its adverse effects (FAE) as well as their associated factors in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). Methods: We conducted a secondary cross-sectional analysis of a database collected by the University of Maryland and Facebook. We included participants aged 18 and over from LAC surveyed, January 15 to February 1, 2021. We evaluated VI, FAE, sociodemographic characteristics, COVID-19 symptomatology, compliance with community mitigation strategies, food and economic insecurity, mental health evaluation and the influence in VI when recommended by different stakeholders. We calculated crude and adjusted prevalence ratios with their 95%CIs. Results: We analyzed 472,521 responses by Latin American adults, finding a VI and FAE prevalence of 80.0% and 81.2%, respectively. We found that female and non-binary genders were associated with a lower probability of VI and a higher probability of FAE. Besides, living in a town, village or rural area and economic insecurity was associated with a higher FAE probability. The fears of becoming seriously ill, a family member becoming seriously ill from COVID-19 and having depressive symptoms were associated with a higher probability of VI and FAE. Conclusion: Eight out of 10 adults in LAC have VI and FAE. The factors identified are useful for the development of communication strategies to reduce FAE frequency.

The growing problem of vaccine hesitancy may affect the uptake of COVID-19 vaccine. We examined the individual, communication and social determinants associated with vaccines uptake.MethodsData come from a nationwide online probability-based panel of 1012 representative adults in the United States and the survey was conducted before the vaccines were available. People under the federal poverty level and racial and ethnic minorities were oversampled. Our outcome variables of interest were likelihood of vaccinating self and likelihood of vaccinating people under one's care (such as children) measuring behavioral intentions. Independent variables included perceptions of risk, exposure to different media for COVID-19 news, political party identification, confidence in scientists and social determinants of health. Logistic regression analysis was used to ascertain the effects of independent variables on the two outcome variables.ResultsThe results indicated that 68 and 65% agreed to get the vaccine for themselves and people under their care, respectively. Risk perceptions (severity of and susceptibility to COVID-19) were significantly associated with vaccine uptake. People who relied on conservative news outlets, Republicans, and who had low confidence in scientists are least likely to vaccinate self or children. Non-Hispanic Blacks and those with least schooling were also less likely to receive vaccine for themselves or people in their care.ConclusionsOur study identified race/ethnicity, risk perceptions, exposure to different media for COVID-19 news, party identification and confidence in scientists as factors that would be affecting COVID-19 vaccine uptake.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the extent of vaccination coverage and intention to vaccinate among college students. College students (N = 457) enrolled in the Spring 2021 semester at a university in New Jersey completed a cross-sectional survey. The survey collected information on demographics, COVID-19 and vaccination history, knowledge levels and sources of COVID-19 vaccine information, and vaccine attitudes. Multivariable regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with vaccination, and the intention to vaccinate among non-vaccinated students. Results indicate that 23% (n = 105) of participants reported being vaccinated already. Among non-vaccinated students, 52.8% indicated their intention to receive the vaccine when it is made available to college students.

Patterns of media use have also been associated with acceptance of COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs. Here we ask whether the type of media on which a person relies increased, decreased, or had no additional effect on that person's COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs over a 4-month period. Objective: We used panel data to explore whether use of conservative and social media in the United States, which were previously found to be positively related to holding conspiracy beliefs about the origins and prevention of COVID-19, were associated with a net increase in the strength of those beliefs from March to July of 2020. We also asked whether mainstream news sources, which were previously found to be negatively related to belief in pandemic-related conspiracies, were associated with a net decrease in the strength of such beliefs over the study period. Additionally, we asked whether subsequent changes in pandemic conspiracy beliefs related to the use of media were also related to subsequent mask wearing and vaccination intentions. Methods: A survey that we conducted with a national US probability sample in March of 2020 and again in July with the same 840 respondents assessed belief in pandemic-related conspiracies, use of various types of media information sources, actions taken to prevent the spread of the disease and intentions to vaccinate, and various demographic characteristics. Change across the two waves was analyzed using path analytic techniques. Results: We found that conservative media use predicted an increase in conspiracy beliefs (beta=.17, 99% CI.10-.25) and that reliance on mainstream print predicted a decrease in their belief (beta=-.08, 99% CI -.14 to -.02). Although many social media platforms reported downgrading or removing false or misleading content, ongoing use of such platforms by respondents predicted growth in conspiracy beliefs as well (beta=.072, 99% CI.018-.123). Importantly, conspiracy belief changes related to media use between the two waves of the study were associated with the uptake of mask wearing and changes in vaccination intentions in July. Unlike other media, use of mainstream broadcast television predicted greater mask wearing (beta=.17, 99% CI.09-.26) and vaccination intention (beta=.08, 95% CI.02-.14), independent of conspiracy beliefs. Conclusions: The findings point to the need for greater efforts on the part of commentators, reporters, and guests on conservative media to report verifiable information about the pandemic. The results also suggest that social media platforms need to be more aggressive in downgrading, blocking, and counteracting claims about COVID-19 vaccines, claims about mask wearing, and conspiracy beliefs that have been judged problematic by public health authorities.",,,,,"Romer, Daniel/0000-0002-2568-0669",,,,,,,,,,,,1438-8871,,,,,APR 27,2021,23,4,,,,,,,e25215,10.2196/25215,,,,,,,WOS:000646925500002,33857008,,,,,,,,

Methods: A questionnaire about COVID-19 vaccination was conducted with 343 healthcare providers, including pediatricians, pediatric nurses, and auxiliary health staff. The questionnaire was conducted online. In the survey, participants were asked about sociodemographic characteristics and opinions on domestic and foreign COVID-19 vaccines, and reasons for vaccine refusal. Results: Women were more likely to be reluctant to get a domestic (p < .001) or foreign (p < .001) COVID-19 vaccine than men. There was a significant relationship between age and vaccine acceptance (p = .01). The younger the age of the healthcare provider, the higher the rate of vaccine hesitancy (r = - 0.25). Years of professional experience were correlated with vaccine acceptance (r = 0,19, p < .05), but vaccine rejection and indecision did not change (p > .05).

We further found a decline in general vaccine attitudes and intentions of getting the influenza vaccine. Analyses of heterogeneity indicated that this decline is driven by participants who identify as Republicans, who showed a negative trend in vaccine attitudes and intentions, whereas Democrats remained largely stable.

Therefore, the purpose of this review was to identify relevant peer-reviewed literature in this area to thematically produce evidence-based recommendations that would inform community planning and response amongst homeless populations. Although this review is inspired by the COVID-19 pandemic, our intention was to produce relevant recommendations to for all current and future outbreaks and pandemics more generally. Our search criteria focused on pandemics and rapid-spread illnesses such as contagious respiratory diseases with contact spread and with an emphasis on individuals experiencing homelessness. Content analysis methods were followed to extract and thematically synthesise key information amongst the 223 articles that matched our search criteria between the years of 1984 and 2020. Two reviewers were assigned to the screening process and used Covidence and undertook two rounds of discussion to identify and finalise themes for extraction. This review illustrates that the current breadth of academic literature on homeless populations has thus far focused on tuberculosis (TB) rather than diseases that are more recent and closely related to COVID-19-such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) or H1N1. Our thematic content analysis revealed six themes that offer tangible and scalable recommendations which include (1) education and outreach, (2) adapting structure of services, (3) screening and contract tracing, (4) transmission and prevention strategies, (5) shelter protocols and (6) treatment, adherence and vaccination. The breadth and depth of reviews such as these are dependent on the quantity and quality of the available literature. Therefore, the limited existing literature outside of tuberculosis specific to homelessness in this review illustrates a need for more academic research into the intersections of pandemics and homelessness-particularly for evaluations of response and planning.

High trust in MS was associated with intention to encourage family members to get COVID-19 vaccines, altruistic beliefs that more vulnerable people should have vaccine priority, and belief that racial minorities with higher rates of COVID-19 deaths should have priority. High trust in PCS was associated with intention to discourage friends from getting vaccinated.

Out of 2653 eligible factory workers, 2053 (77.4%) completed the online survey. Multivariate two-level logistic regression models and ordinal logistic regression models were fitted. Results: The prevalence of behavioral intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccination was 66.6% (n=1368, conditional on 80% vaccine efficacy and market rate) and 80.6% (n=1655, conditional on 80% vaccine efficacy and free vaccines). After adjusting for significant background characteristics, positive attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.20, 95% CI 1.15-1.25 and AOR 1.24, 95% CI 1.19-1.30), perceived support from significant others for getting a COVID-19 vaccination (AOR 1.43, 95% CI 1.32-1.55 and AOR 1.37, 95% CI 1.25-1.50), and perceived behavioral control to get a COVID-19 vaccination (AOR 1.51, 95% CI 1.32-1.73 and AOR 1.28, 95% CI 1.09-1.51) were positively associated with both dependent variables (conditional on 80% vaccine efficacy and market rate or free vaccines, respectively). Regarding social media influence, higher frequency of exposure to positive information related to COVID-19 vaccination was associated with a higher intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccination at market rate (AOR 1.53, 95% CI 1.39-1.70) or a free vaccination (AOR 1.52, 95% CI 1.35-1.71). Higher self-reported compliance with wearing a face mask in the workplace (AOR 1.27, 95% CI 1.02-1.58 and AOR 1.67, 95% CI 1.24-2.27) and other public spaces (AOR 1.80, 95% CI 1.42-2.29 and AOR 1.34, 95% CI 1.01-1.77), hand hygiene (AOR 1.21, 95% CI 1.00-1.47 and AOR 1.52, 95% CI 1.19-1.93), and avoiding social gatherings (AOR 1.22, 95% CI 1.01-1.47 and AOR 1.55, 95% CI 1.23-1.95) and crowded places (AOR 1.24, 95% CI 1.02-1.51 and AOR 1.73, 95% CI 1.37-2.18) were also positively associated with both dependent variables. The number of COVID-19 preventive measures implemented by the factory was positively associated with the intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccination under both scenarios (AOR 1.08, 95% CI 1.04-1.12 and AOR 1.06, 95% CI 1.01-1.11). Conclusions: Factory workers in China reported a high behavioral intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccination. The theory of planned behavior is a useful framework to guide the development of future campaigns promoting COVID-19 vaccination.",,,,,"Fang, Yuan/0000-0003-1154-5076",,,,,,,,,,,,1438-8871,,,,,MAR 9,2021,23,3,,,,,,,e24673,10.2196/24673,,,,,,,WOS:000626721300004,33646966,,,,,,,,

With the call for vaccination as a crucial step toward educational recovery, it is important to study the intentions of teachers to vaccinate against COVID-19. Thus, this article aimed to examine the intentions of Filipino teachers to vaccinate against COVID-19. A sample of 1070 K to 12 teachers from Mindanao, Philippines participated in the online survey. The collected data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The results showed that a large majority of the teachers are uncertain about whether they will vaccinate against COVID-19 or not. When looking into the underlying reasons, they expressed that they do not have enough knowledge about the vaccine and are concerned about its potential side effects. The results further revealed that gender, monthly income, and educational attainment were significantly associated with the intention to vaccinate against COVID-19. Lastly, it was found out that a low level of barriers significantly predicted the intention of the teachers to vaccinate against COVID-19. Considering these results, this paper underscores the need for concerned authorities to strategically focus on addressing the persistence of hesitancy by campaigning for vaccine literacy and information resilience so that teachers will vaccinate when appropriate.",,,,"Cahapay, Michael B./AAW-2455-2020","Cahapay, Michael B./0000-0002-0588-0022",,,,,,,,,,,,1091-1359,1540-3556,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1080/10911359.2021.1896409,,MAR 2021,,,,,WOS:000642576100001,,,,,,,,,

Employees from Greece (N = 1006) participated from October 1 to November 5, 2020, in an anonymous online factorial survey experiment. Measures of dispositional optimism, faith in intuition, risk-taking propensity, and acquiring resources mindset were included as individual difference variables. Multilevel modeling techniques were used for data analyses. Components of HBM had significant effects on intentions to vaccinate. Two-way interactions between severity and susceptibility beliefs and three-way interaction among perceived severity, susceptibility, and perceived benefits were detected. In line with the events systems theory, a critical event moderated beliefs' effects on intention to vaccinate.

This model has been used to explain health-defeating reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., intentional nonadherence to mitigation guidelines) and to inform recommendations for current and future public health campaigns. Unfortunately, these recommendations do not account for psychological reactance, an aversive motivational state known to undermine persuasive messages. For this reason, we argue that the TMHM for pandemics is incomplete in its current form and should be expanded to account for reactance processes. We also highlight two reactance-reducing strategies (inoculation messages and restoration postscripts) that could potentially increase the efficacy of the public health messages proposed by the TMHM for pandemics. We conclude with a discussion of how psychological reactance theory can augment the TMHM more broadly.

Intellectual humility, a virtue characterized by nonjudgmental recognition of one's own intellectual fallibility, may counter rigidity associated with anti-vaccination attitudes and help promote vaccine-related behaviors. This study investigated whether intellectual humility is related to anti-vaccination attitudes and intentions to vaccinate against COVID-19, and whether intellectual humility can predict unique variance in these outcomes beyond participant demographic and personal factors. Participants (N = 351, 57.23% male, mean age = 37.41 years, SD = 11.51) completed a multidimensional measure for intellectual humility, the anti-vaccination attitudes (VAX) scale, and a two-item COVID-19 vaccination intention scale. Bivariate correlations demonstrated that intellectual humility was negatively related with anti-vaccination attitudes overall, r(349) = -.46, p < .001, and positively related to intentions to vaccinate against COVID-19, r(349) = .20, p < .001. Hierarchical multiple regression revealed that intellectual humility predicted all four types anti-vaccination attitudes, overall anti-vaccination attitudes, and COVID-19 vaccination intentions above and beyond demographic and personal factors (i.e., sex, race/ethnicity, age, education, socioeconomic status, and political orientation), Delta R-2 between .08 and .18, ps < .001.

Methods: A survey of 788 U.S. adults was conducted to explore the relationships between demographics and psychosocial predictors of intent to get a future COVID-19 vaccine as well as willingness to get such a vaccine under EUA. Results: Significant predictors of COVID-19 vaccine uptake intentions were education, having insurance, scoring high on subjective norms, a positive attitude toward the vaccine, as well as high perceived susceptibility to COVID-19, high perceived benefits of the vaccine, scoring low on barriers to the vaccine, and scoring high on self-efficacy. Predictors of willingness to take a COVID-19 vaccine under EUA were age, race/ethnicity, positive subjective norms, high perceived behavioral control, positive attitudes toward the vaccine, as well as high perceived susceptibility to COVID-19, high perceived benefits of the vaccine, low barriers to the vaccine, and scoring high on self-efficacy for getting the vaccine. Concerns about rushed vaccine development appear to reduce vaccine uptake intent, as well as willingness to get the vaccine under EUA. Conclusions: COVID-19 vaccine-related messages should both address concerns about the vaccine and its development and reinforce benefits of the vaccine (both factors significant in both models). Vaccine efforts may need to go beyond just communications campaigns correcting misinformation about a COVID-19 vaccine to also focus on re-establishing public trust in government agencies.

This research examines how prosocial concern for vaccination, defined as people's preoccupation with infecting others if they do not vaccinate themselves, motivates vaccination in more and less populated regions of the United States. A nationally representative, longitudinal survey of 2,490 Americans showed that prosocial concern had a larger positive influence on vaccination against influenza in sparser regions, as judged by a region's nonmetropolitan status, lesser population density, and lower proportion of urban land area. Two experiments (total n = 800), one preregistered, provide causal evidence that drawing attention to prosocial (vs. individual) concerns interacted with social density to affect vaccination intentions. Specifically, prosocial concern led to stronger intentions to vaccinate against influenza and COVID-19 but only when social density was low (vs. high). Moderated mediation analyses show that, in low-density conditions, the benefits of inducing prosocial concern were due to greater perceived impact of one's vaccination on others. In this light, public health communications may reap more benefits from emphasizing the prosocial aspects of vaccination in sparser environments.",,,,,"Jung, Haesung/0000-0001-8451-3839",,,,,,,,,,,,0027-8424,,,,,JAN 5,2021,118,1,,,,,,,e2007538118,10.1073/pnas.2007538118,,,,,,,WOS:000607270100011,33443183,,,,,,,,

A three-stage sampling was adopted, considering stratum, census tracts, and domicile. After systematic analysis, thirty sectors were selected in each stratum, totaling 150 sectors. Each sector contained a fixed number of 34 households, thus totaling 5,100 households. One individual within each household (resident for at least six months and aged one year or more) was selected by a simple random sampling. We questioned participants about their vaccination intention. Univariate association between independent variables and the outcome were verified using descriptive analysis (weighted frequencies) and Pearson's chi-square test (p < 0.05). Robust multivariate analysis was performed using a three-level hierarchical model. RESULTS: We found 17.5% (95%CI 16.1-19.1%) of the 4,630 individuals interviewed to report hesitancy to be vaccinated against covid-19. After final model adjustment, vaccination hesitancy was statistically higher among residents of the cities of Imperatriz (24.0%; RP = 1.48; IC95% 1.09-2.02) and municipalities of the Grande Ilha de Sao Luis (20.7%; RP = 1.34; 95%CI 1.02-1.76), female individuals (19.8%; RP = 1.44; 95%CI 1.20-1.75), older adults (22.8%; RP = 1.79; IC95% 1.30-2.46), evangelicals (24.1%; RP = 1.49; 95% CI 1.24-1.79), and those without reported symptoms (18.6%; RP = 1.24; 95%CI 1.02-1.51).

In some studies, for example, education was neither a significant determinant of vaccination knowledge nor consistently linked with the intention to get vaccinated against vaccine-preventable diseases. Trust in the healthcare system is also known to be a determinant of health-related attitudes and behaviours. However, it remains unclear whether trust in the healthcare system moderates the effect of education on vaccination knowledge and vaccine uptake intention. In our study, we examined whether in Slovenia education is linked to higher levels of knowledge about vaccination, whether education is linked with a greater intention to get vaccinated against Covid-19, and whether trust in the healthcare system moderates the effect of education. We analysed two non-representative samples obtained through online surveys in November 2019 (Study 1; N = 661; 76% women) and in March/April 2020 (Study 2; N = 851; 84% women). We compared three educational groups (1 = secondary school or lower; 2 = up to the first-cycle Bologna degree; 3 = second-cycle Bologna degree or higher). Multivariate analyses showed that, when controlling for other determinants (gender, age, employment/activity status, self-rated health and political orientation), the mid-level education group showed the lowest level of vaccination knowledge (Study 1) and the lowest Covid-19 vaccine uptake intention (Study 2). Additionally, we found that trust in the healthcare system moderated the effects of education. Among high-trust groups, higher education had a significant positive impact only on Covid-19 vaccine uptake intention (Study 2) but had no significant impact on vaccine knowledge (Study 1). Among low-trust groups, the educational impact was similar for both outcomes; the mid-level educational groups had significantly lower Covid-19 vaccine uptake intention and vaccine knowledge, while the highest and the lowest educational group had the most vaccine knowledge and uptake intention.

METHODS: Up to December 28, 2020 we identifi ed 62 relevant peer-reviewed articles in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus and GoogleScholar. RESULTS: Total sample size was 118 855 respondents with overall average COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rate of 72.5% which is just the level estimated to be suffi cient for reaching herd immunity threshold. Surprisingly, healthcare workers showed smaller interest in receiving the vaccine when compared to general adult population and university students. On the other hand, their attitude to vaccination did not change over time. In case of general adult population, the longer the pandemic lasts, the smaller proportion of population wants to get vaccinated. Vaccination intentions were independent of gross domestic product and human development index. CONCLUSION: Willingness of population to receive COVID-19 is just at the herd immunity threshold and it is decreasing over time (Tab. 2, Fig. 3, Ref. 110).

Once COVID-19 vaccines become widely available, it will be necessary to maximize public vaccine acceptance and coverage. Objective: This research aimed to analyze the predictors of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in Russia. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among Russian adults from September 26th to November 9th, 2020. Predictors of the intent to take up COVID-19 vaccination were explored using logistic regression. Results: Out of 876 participants, 365 (41.7%) would be willing to receive the vaccine if it became available. Acceptance increased for a vaccine with verified safety and effectiveness (63.2%). Intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccine was relatively higher among males (aOR=2.37, 95% CI 1.41-4.00), people with lower monthly income (aOR=2.94, 95%CI 1.32-6.57), and with positive trust in the healthcare system (aOR=2.73, 95% CI 1.76-4.24). The Russian people were more likely to accept the COVID-19 vaccine if they believed that the vaccine reduces the risk of virus infection (aOR=8.80, 95%CI 5.21-14.87) or relieves the complications of the disease (aOR=10.46, 95%CI 6.09-17.96). Other barriers such as being unconcerned about side-effects (aOR=1.65, 95%CI 1.03-2.65) and the effectiveness and safety of the vaccination (aOR=2.55, 95%CI 1.60-4.08), also affected acceptance. Conclusions: The study showed the usefulness of the health belief model constructs in understanding the COVID-19 vaccination acceptance rate in the Russian population. This rate was influenced by sociodemographic and health-related characteristics, and health beliefs. These findings might help guide future efforts for policymakers and stakeholders to improve vaccination rates by enhancing trust in the healthcare system.",,,,"Practice, Pharmacy/AAP-5629-2020","Pham, Duy Toan/0000-0002-8693-3367; Pak, Tatiana/0000-0003-0882-6053; Tran, Van De/0000-0003-0421-5079; Dewey, Rebecca/0000-0002-6888-3298",,,,,,,,,,,,1885-642X,1886-3655,,,,JAN-MAR,2021,19,1,,,,,,,2276,10.18549/PharmPract.2021.1.2276,,,,,,,WOS:000663380400012,33828622,,,,,,,,

This study aims to investigate the factors that might affect students' preference for virtual learning. Since a second wave of such pandemic is expected to occur, professors and teaching assistants may want to be prepared and aware to create an effective virtual learning environment for students. Using an online survey questionnaire, a total of 488 students in their basic science years of study (first to the third year) who are enrolled in dental and medical college responded to the online survey. The authors utilized a binary logistic regression model to estimate the impact of the nine explanatory variables (gender, student's year of study, accessibility of online tools, class engagement in virtual classes, GPA change during COVID-19 outbreak, class attendance in virtual vs. in-person lectures, type of study material, time saving for virtual classes, and anxiety level during the COVID-19 outbreak) on the students' preference for virtual learning. The analysis of variance showed that three out of the nine variables were not significant to the model: gender, study level, and study material. In addition, to understand the behavioral intention for the students during such pandemic, the online survey questionnaire captured students' voice on their willingness to wear masks, wash their hands, or both as well as their acceptance to take the vaccine once it is available. The results showed that 7.02 % of the students did not change simple health behaviors and 18.43% are not interested in taking the vaccine.

Public health strategy to address emerging infectious diseases has depended in part on human behavior change and yet the perceptions and knowledge motivating that behavior have been at times inconsistent with the latest consensus of peer-reviewed science. Part of that disjuncture likely involves the existence and persistence of past ideas about other diseases. To forecast and prepare for future epidemic and pandemic response, we need to better understand how people approach emerging infectious diseases as objects of public opinion during the periods when such diseases first become salient at a population level. In this essay, we explore two examples of how existing mental models of past infectious diseases appear to have conditioned and constrained public response to novel viral diseases. We review previously reported experiences related to Zika virus in Central America and discuss public opinion data collected in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the case of Zika virus disease, we assess how thinking about earlier mosquito-borne disease seems to have affected public consideration of the virus in Guatemala.

However, for vaccination efforts to succeed, there must be widespread willingness to vaccinate. Prior research has found that Black Americans, who are disproportionately impacted by COVID-19, report lower intentions to get a vaccine than do other populations. We investigate two potential contributors to this disparity: COVID-19 vaccine-related behavioral beliefs and trust in four COVID-19 information sources (mainstream media, social media, President Trump, and public health officials and agencies). Using a nationally-representative survey (n= 889), we demonstrate that differences in vaccination beliefs explain the lower vaccination intentions reported by Black participants, compared to non-Black participants. However, while trust in information sources is associated with vaccination beliefs, differences in trust do not account for the observed differences in vaccination beliefs by race. Furthermore, we find that race moderates the relationships between trust in two sources (Trump and public health officials and agencies) and vaccination beliefs. The effects of trusting these sources on COVID-19 vaccine-related beliefs are smaller among Black participants; thus trust in these sources is less consequential to their pro-vaccination beliefs. Our results suggest that trust in information sources alone does not explain the observed relationship between race and vaccination beliefs.",,,,,"Woko, Chioma/0000-0001-7014-5684; Siegel, Leeann/0000-0002-3033-2474; Hornik, Robert/0000-0002-2148-8805",,,,,,,,,,,,1081-0730,1087-0415,,,,OCT 2,2020,25,10,,,SI,,819,826,,10.1080/10810730.2020.1864521,,,,,,,WOS:000628894300014,33719874,,,,,,,,

Objective: Because the novel coronavirus is highly contagious, the widespread use of preventive measures such as masking, physical distancing, and eventually vaccination is needed to bring it under control. We hypothesized that accepting conspiracy theories that were circulating in mainstream and social media early in the COVID-19 pandemic in the US would be negatively related to the uptake of preventive behaviors and also of vaccination when a vaccine becomes available. Method: A national probability survey of US adults (N = 1050) was conducted in the latter half of March 2020 and a follow-up with 840 of the same individuals in July 2020. The surveys assessed adoption of preventive measures recommended by public health authorities, vaccination intentions, conspiracy beliefs, perceptions of threat, belief about the safety of vaccines, political ideology, and media exposure patterns. Results: Belief in three COVID-19-related conspiracy theories was highly stable across the two periods and inversely related to the (a) perceived threat of the pandemic, (b) taking of preventive actions, including wearing a face mask, (c) perceived safety of vaccination, and (d) intention to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Conspiracy beliefs in March predicted subsequent mask-wearing and vaccination intentions in July even after controlling for action taken and intentions in March. Although adopting preventive behaviors was predicted by political ideology and conservative media reliance, vaccination intentions were less related to political ideology. Mainstream television news use predicted adopting both preventive actions and vaccination. Conclusions: Because belief in COVID-related conspiracy theories predicts resistance to both preventive behaviors and future vaccination for the virus, it will be critical to confront both conspiracy theories and vaccination misinformation to prevent further spread of the virus in the US. Reducing those barriers will require continued messaging by public health authorities on mainstream media and in particular on politically conservative outlets that have supported COVID-related conspiracy theories.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0277-9536,,,,,OCT,2020,263,,,,,,,,113356,10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113356,,,,,,,WOS:000579852400010,32967786,,,,,,,,

Development of a vaccine against COVID-19 will be key to controlling the pandemic. We need to understand the barriers and facilitators to receiving a future COVID-19 vaccine so that we can provide recommendations for the design of interventions aimed at maximizing public acceptance. Design. Cross-sectional UK survey with older adults and patients with chronic respiratory disease. Methods. During the UK's early April 2020 'lockdown' period, 527 participants (311 older adults, mean age = 70.4 years; 216 chronic respiratory participants, mean age = 43.8 years) completed an online questionnaire assessing willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, perceptions of COVID-19, and intention to receive influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations. A free text response (n = 502) examined barriers and facilitators to uptake. The Behaviour Change Wheel informed the analysis of these responses, which were coded to the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). Behaviour change techniques (BCTs) were identified. Results. Eighty-six per cent of respondents want to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. This was positively correlated with the perception that COVID-19 will persist over time, and negatively associated with perceiving the media to have over-exaggerated the risk. The majority of barriers and facilitators were mapped onto the 'beliefs about consequences' TDF domain, with themes relating to personal health, health consequences to others, concerns of vaccine safety, and severity of COVID-19. Conclusions. Willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccination is currently high among high-risk individuals.

The papers generally argue that controlled human infection (CHI) is ethically acceptable if (1) the risks to participants are low and therefore acceptable, (2) the scientific quality of the research is high, (3) the research has high social value, (4) participants give full informed consent, and (5) there is fair selection of participants.

The arguments concerning risk and informed consent have already been critically discussed in the literature. This paper therefore looks specifically at the arguments relating to condition 3 'high social value' and condition 5 'fair selection of participants' and shows that whereas they may be valid, they are not sound.

To prepare for public availability, the acceptability of a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine and willingness to pay (WTP) were assessed to provide insights into future demand forecasts and pricing considerations. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted from 3 to 12 April 2020. The health belief model (HBM) was used to assess predictors of the intent to receive the vaccine and the WTP. Results A total of 1,159 complete responses was received. The majority reported a definite intent to receive the vaccine (48.2%), followed by a probable intent (29.8%) and a possible intent (16.3%). Both items under the perceived benefits construct in the HBM, namely believe the vaccination decreases the chance of infection (OR = 2.51, 95% CI 1.19-5.26) and the vaccination makes them feel less worry (OR = 2.19, 95% CI 1.03-4.65), were found to have the highest significant odds of a definite intention to take the vaccine.

In addition, information from naturally exposed individuals and animal models to coronavirus strains is described for the same purpose of helping into the development of effective vaccines against COVID-19.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2193-8229,2193-6382,,,,JUN,2020,9,2,,,,,255,274,,10.1007/s40121-020-00300-x,,APR 2020,,,,,WOS:000528514200001,32328406,,,,,,,,

Methods: A nationally representative survey based on 1055 Italians aged 15-85 years was conducted in September 16-28, 2020. Results: We found that 40.8% of the population reported the intention to be vaccinated against influenza next winter and 53.7% would accept to receive a potential COVID-19 vaccine. The percentages were higher among individuals aged 55 and over (58.8% for influenza vaccine and 58.2% for a potential COYID-19 vaccine) and among professionals, managers and teachers as compared to manual workers and farmers (36.1% vs. 27.6% for influenza vaccine and 51.6% vs. 44.8% for a potential COVID-19 vaccine). Discussion: These data confirm a certain degree of vaccine mistrust in Italy, especially among less qualified workers.",,,,"Alicandro, Gianfranco/AAR-4989-2021","Alicandro, Gianfranco/0000-0002-0430-2714",,,,,,,,,,,,0025-7818,,,,,,2020,111,6,,,,,445,448,,10.23749/mdl.v111i6.10813,,,,,,,WOS:000599641000003,33311419,,,,,,,,
