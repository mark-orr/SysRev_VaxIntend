The current paper attempts to conduct a critical interpretative synthesis (CIS) on the role of herd immunity in current COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: CIS is tool for developing theoretical framework using interpretation drawn from relevant empirical and non-empirical sources. This review is done by formulating review question for literature search. Purposive sampling of literature was done followed by reciprocal translational analysis of extracted data. Results: Herd immunity is indirect protection from a contagious infectious disease when a population is immune either through vaccination or natural immunity developed through previous infection. The reproduction number for COVID-19 in India was found to be 2.56 and herd immunity threshold as 61%. Discussion: Exposing 71% young population in India to the SARS-CoV-2 infection can achieve herd immunity but with high morbidity as well as mortality. Vaccine are under process. Feco-oral transmission and reinfection of COVID 19 are major factors to develop or break the circle of herd immunity in community. Immunity passport can give false sense of security. Surveillance and seroprevalence studies assess immunity status, gradual exposure of infection to younger population and collaborative partnerships on organizations are few strategies to acquire herd immunity. Conclusion: Herd immunity is a measure for prevention and control of COVID-19 pandemic against the backdrop of mortality and morbidity. Vaccine can be boon but if herd immunity is to be acquired by natural infection then preparedness is necessary.",MAR,2021,10,3,,WOS:000648447400007,34041138,,,,
1002,"Marcec, Robert; Majta, Matea; Likic, Robert",Will vaccination refusal prolong the war on SARS-CoV-2?,POSTGRADUATE MEDICAL JOURNAL,"Introduction Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus that appeared in Wuhan, China in January 2020 and caused a global pandemic drastically changing everyday life. Currently, there are vaccine candidates in clinical trials and development, so it is only a matter of time before one is authorised for human use. Materials and methods We collected public opinion survey results about attitudes towards SARS-CoV-2 vaccination conducted in 2020 in 26 European countries. Results The pooled surveys were conducted on a total of 24 970 participants; on average only 58% (n=14 365/24 970) of responders across Europe were willing to get a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine once it becomes available, 16% (n=3998/24 970) were neutral, and 26% (n=6607/24 970) were not planning to vaccinate against SARS-CoV-2. Such a low vaccination response could make it exceedingly difficult to reach the herd immunity threshold for SARS-CoV-2 through vaccination. Conclusion It is very important to start conducting educational public health activities on the topic of vaccination as soon as possible, before a vaccine becomes available, in order to improve attitudes towards SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Only by educating the general public about the benefits, safety and efficacy of vaccines can we hope to avoid the unnecessary prolongation of the COVID-19 pandemic.",MAR,2021,97,1145,,WOS:000624065800005,33115909,yes,25K,1,1

This study analyzed plasma samples from 126 eligible convalescent blood donors in addition to 15 naive individuals, as well as an additional 20 convalescent individuals as a validation cohort. Multiplexed Fc Array binding assays and functional antibody response assays were utilized to evaluate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody composition and activity. Donor convalescent plasma samples contained a range of antibody cell- and complement-mediated effector functions, indicating the diverse antiviral activity of humoral responses observed among recovered individuals. In addition to viral neutralization, convalescent plasma samples contained antibodies capable of mediating such Fc-dependent functions as complement activation, phagocytosis, and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity against SARS-CoV-2. Plasma samples from a fraction of eligible donors exhibited high activity across all activities evaluated. These polyfunctional plasma samples could be identified with high accuracy with even single Fc Array features, whose correlation with polyfunctional activity was confirmed in the validation cohort. Collectively, these results expand understanding of the diversity of antibody-mediated antiviral functions associated with convalescent plasma, and the polyfunctional antiviral functions suggest that it could retain activity even when its neutralizing capacity is reduced by mutations in variant SARS-CoV-2. IMPORTANCE Convalescent plasma has been deployed globally as a treatment for COVID-19, but efficacy has been mixed. Better understanding of the antibody characteristics that may contribute to its antiviral effects is important for this intervention as well as offer insights into correlates of vaccine-mediated protection. Here, a survey of convalescent plasma activities, including antibody neutralization and diverse effector functions, was used to define plasma samples with broad activity profiles. These polyfunctional plasma samples could be reliably identified in multiple cohorts by multiplex assay, presenting a widely deployable screening test for plasma selection and investigation of vaccine-elicited responses.",MAR-APR,2021,12,2,,WOS:000697573400006,,,,,

Three key factors contribute to the pathogenesis of COVID-19: excessive inflammation, immune system depression/inhibition, and a set of proinflammatory cytokines. Common to these factors, a central function of oxidative stress has been highlighted. A diversity of clinical trials focused predominantly on antioxidants are being implemented as potential therapies for COVID-19. In this study, we look at the role of zinc, glutathione, and polyphenols, as key antioxidants of possible medicinal or nutritional significance, and examine their role in the antiviral immune response induced by SARS-Cov-2. An unresolved question is why some people experience chronic COVID and others do not. Understanding the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and the immune system, as well as the role of defective immune responses to disease development, would be essential to recognize the pathogenesis of COVID-19, the risk factors that affect the harmful consequences of the disease, and the rational design of successful therapies and vaccinations. We expect that our research will provide a novel perspective that contributes to the design of clinical or nutritional targets for the prevention of this pandemic.",MAR,2021,9,3,,WOS:000634257500001,,,,,

To secure the full benefits of mass vaccination, which started in early January 2021, it is of utmost importance to complement it with mid-term non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). The objective was to minimize human losses and to limit social and economic costs. In this paper a two-phase stochastic dynamic network compartmental model (a pre-vaccination SEIR until 15 February 2021 and a post-vaccination SVEIR from 15 February 2021 to 30 June 2021) is developed. Three scenarios are assessed for the first phase: (a) A baseline scenario, which lifts the national lockdown and all NPIs in January 2021; (b) a semi-lockdown scenario with school opening, partial retail sector operation, universal mask wearing, and social distancing/teleworking in January 2021; and (c) a rolling lockdown scenario combining a partial lifting of measures in January 2021 followed by a third nationwide lockdown in February 2021. In the second phase three scenarios with different vaccination rates are assessed. Publicly available data along with some first results of the SHARE COVID-19 survey conducted in Greece are used as input. The results regarding the first phase indicate that the semi-lockdown scenario clearly outperforms the third lockdown scenario (5.7% less expected fatalities); the second phase is extremely sensitive on the availability of sufficient vaccine supplies and high vaccination rates.",MAR,2021,18,5,,WOS:000628167300001,33802501,,,,

Hence, a COVID-19 mandatory vaccination as a precondition for international travel is being debated in many countries. Thus, the present research aimed to study the intention to take the COVID-19 vaccine as a precondition for international travel using an extended Norm-Activation Model. The study model integrates a new construct, namely mass media coverage on COVID-19 vaccination as additional predictor of intention to take the COVID-19 vaccine. The survey data were collected from 1221 international travelers. Structural equation modelling shows a very good fit of the final model to the data; the conceptual model based on extended Norm-Activation Model was strongly supported. Awareness of consequences related to the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals' health has shown a positive effect on individuals' ascribed responsibility to adopt emotionally driven (anticipated pride and anticipated guilt) pro-social behaviors that activate a personal norm towards altruistic and pro-mandatory vaccination-friendly behavior.

This article proposes a first measure of familiarity with and attitude toward clinical research in France. Drawing from the Health Literacy Survey 2019 (HLS19) conducted online between 27 May and 5 June 2020 on a sample of the French adult population (N = 1003), we show that a significant proportion of the French population claimed some familiarity with clinical trials (64.8%) and had positive attitudes (72%) toward them. One of the important findings of this study is that positive attitudes toward clinical research exist side by side with a strong distancing from the pharmaceutical industry. While respondents acknowledged that the pharmaceutical industry plays an important role in clinical research (68.3%), only one-quarter indicated that they trust the industry (25.7%). Positive attitudes toward clinical trials were associated with familiarity with clinical trials (Odds Ratio, OR 2.97 [1.90-4.63]), financial difficulties (OR 0.63 [0.46-0.85]), as well as mistrust of doctors (0.48 [0.27-0.85]) and of scientists (OR 0.62 [0.38-0.99]). Although the French media provided a great deal of information on how clinical research works during the first months of the pandemic, there remains profound mistrust of the pharmaceutical industry in France. This suspicion can undermine crisis management, especially in the areas of vaccine development and preparation for future pandemics.",MAR,2021,18,5,,WOS:000628150100001,33807787,,,,
1008,"Shayak, B.; Sharma, Mohit M.; Gaur, Manas; Mishra, Anand Kumar",Impact of reproduction number on the multiwave spreading dynamics of COVID-19 with temporary immunity: A mathematical model,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES,"Objectives: The recent discoveries of phylogenetically confirmed COVID-19 reinfection cases worldwide, together with studies suggesting that antibody titres decrease over time, raise the question of what course the epidemic trajectories may take if immunity were really to be temporary in a significant fraction of the population. The objective of this study is to obtain an answer for this important question. Methods: We construct a ground-up delay differential equation model tailored to incorporate different types of immune response. We considered two immune responses: (a) short-lived immunity of all types, and (b) short-lived sterilizing immunity with durable severity-reducing immunity. Results: Multiple wave solutions to the model are manifest for intermediate values of the reproduction number R; interestingly, for sufficiently low as well as sufficiently high R, we find conventional singlewave solutions despite temporary immunity. Conclusions: The versatility of our model, and its very modest demands on computational resources, ensure that a set of disease trajectories can be computed virtually on the same day that a new and relevant immune response study is released. Our work can also be used to analyse the disease dynamics after a vaccine is certified for use and information regarding its immune response becomes available. ? 2021 The Authors.

1009,"Stewart, Mallory",Defending Weapons Inspections from the Effects of Disinformation,AJIL UNBOUND,"The intentional spread of disinformation is not a new challenge for the scientific world. We have seen it perpetuate the idea of a flat earth, convince communities that vaccines are more dangerous than helpful, and even suggest a connection between the 5G communication infrastructure and COVID-19. Nor is disinformation a new phenomenon in the weapons inspection arena. Weapons inspectors themselves are often forced to sift through alternative narratives of events and inconsistent reporting, and they regularly see their credibility and conclusions questioned in the face of government politics or public biases. But certain recent disinformation campaigns have become so overwhelmingly comprehensive and effective that they constitute a new kind of threat. By preventing accountability for clear violations of international law, these campaigns have created a challenge to the survival of arms control treaties themselves. If weapons inspectors cannot regain the trust of the international community in the face of this challenge, it will be increasingly difficult to ensure compliance with arms control and disarmament treaties going forward. In this essay, I will briefly discuss one of the most comprehensive disinformation efforts of the past decade: the disinformation campaign used to prevent accountability for Syria's repeated use of chemical weapons. After this discussion, I will propose one possible approach to help protect the credibility of disarmament experts and weapons inspectors in the face of pervasive disinformation. This approach will require a concerted effort to connect and support compliance experts and to understand and explain their expertise across cultural, political, national, economic, and religious divides.",MAR 1,2021,115,,,WOS:000702235800005,,,,9(wapons inspectors),9

To control the spread of COVID-19, the production of effective vaccines is likely to be one of the best solutions. However, vaccination hesitancy may decrease individuals' willingness to get vaccinated. The Drivers of COVID-19 Vaccination Acceptance Scale (DrVac-COVID19S) was recently developed to help healthcare professionals and researchers better understand vaccination acceptance. The present study examined whether DrVac-COVID19S is measurement invariant across different subgroups (Taiwanese vs. mainland Chinese university students; males vs. females; and health-related program majors vs. non-health-related program majors). Taiwanese (n = 761; mean age = 25.51 years; standard deviation (SD) = 6.42; 63.5% females) and mainland Chinese university students (n = 3145; mean age = 20.72 years; SD = 2.06; 50.2% females) were recruited using an online survey between 5 January and 21 February 2021. Factor structure and measurement invariance of the two DrVac-COVID19S scales (nine-item and 12-item) were tested using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The findings indicated that the DrVac-COVID19S had a four-factor structure and was measurement invariant across the subgroups. The DrVac-COVID19S's four-factor structure was supported by the CFA results is a practical and valid instrument to quickly capture university students' willingness to get COVID-19 vaccination.

Although a few vaccines and drugs have been approved to, respectively, prevent or treat the disease, several clinical trials are still ongoing to test new vaccines or drugs to mitigate the burden of the pandemic. Few studies have shown the role of host genetics in disease prognosis and drug response highlighting the importance of diverse participation in COVID-19 clinical trials. The goal of this study is to assess public attitudes in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan toward participating in COVID-19 clinical trials and to identify the factors that may influence their attitude. An online questionnaire was developed and distributed among the target group through social media platforms. The number of responses was 1,576. Three quarters (74.9%) of participants heard about clinical trials before, 57.6% of them had a positive attitude toward participation in COVID-19 clinical trials. The conduct of clinical trials in accordance with the scientific, research, and ethical guidelines was a strong predictor of willingness to participate in clinical trials. Other positive factors also included protection of family from COVID-19 and contributing to the return to normal community life as well as receiving additional healthcare benefit was the fourth significant predictor. On the other hand, the thought that clinical trials can have a negative impact on the health of participants strongly predicted the unwillingness of individuals to participate in such trials. This was followed by having limited information about the novel coronavirus and COVID-19 and the lack of trust in physicians and hospitals. In general, Arab citizens are accepting the concept and have a positive attitude toward COVID-19 clinical trials. Increasing awareness of COVID-19 and clinical trials, enforcing the concept of altruism, and placing clear policies in conducting clinical trials are needed to increase participation in clinical trials among Arabs.",FEB 23,2021,8,,,WOS:000626453100001,33708777,,,,

Vaccine uptake rate is a crucial determinant for herd immunity. We examined factors associated with acceptance of vaccine based on (1). constructs of the Health Belief Model (HBM), (2). trust in the healthcare system, new vaccine platforms and manufacturers, and (3). self-reported health outcomes. Methods: A population-based, random telephone survey was performed during the peak of the third wave of COVID-19 outbreak (27/07/2020 to 27/08/2020) in Hong Kong. All adults aged >= 18 years were eligible. The survey included sociodemographic details; self-report health conditions; trust scales; and self-reported health outcomes. Multivariable regression analyses were applied to examine independent associations. The primary outcome is the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine. Results: We conducted 1200 successful telephone interviews (response rate 55%). The overall vaccine acceptance rate after adjustment for population distribution was 37.2% (95% C.I. 34.5-39.9%). The projected acceptance rates exhibited a J-shaped pattern with age, with higher rates among young adults (18-24 years), then increased linearly with age. Multivariable regression analyses revealed that perceived severity, perceived benefits of the vaccine, cues to action, self-reported health outcomes, and trust in healthcare system or vaccine manufacturers were positive correlates of acceptance; whilst perceived access barriers and harm were negative correlates. Remarkably, perceived susceptibility to infection carried no significant association, whereas recommendation from Government (aOR = 10.2, 95% C.I. 6.54 to 15.9, p < 0.001) was as the strongest driving factor for acceptance. Other key obstacles of acceptance included lack of confidence on newer vaccine platforms (43.4%) and manufacturers without track record (52.2%), which are of particular relevance to the current context. Conclusions: Governmental recommendation is an important driver, whereas perceived susceptibility is not associated with acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine. These HBM constructs and independent predictors inform evidence-based formulation and implementation of vaccination strategies. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

While this question is usually answered based on demographics (e. g., population age), health policy (e.g., quarantine), or economic factors, we argue that cultural variance across countries is just as crucial in understanding how susceptible a society is to the COVID-19 outbreak. To test this hypothesis, we first analyzed data collected across 69 countries and examined the relationship between culture and the impact of COVID. Next, we conducted two studies to validate our findings further and explore the mechanism at hand. As expected, we found that the more individualistic (vs. collectivistic) a country was, the more COVID-19 cases and mortalities it had. We also found that the more individualistic participants were, the higher the chances they would not adhere to epidemic prevention measures.

It also compares the Jamaican academic library's COVID-19 experience with US academic library's COVID-19 preliminary experience. Design/methodology/approach The local academic libraries in higher education in Jamaica (also referred to in this paper as university libraries) were surveyed. Findings Government mandates, university mandates and the absence of a vaccine influenced academic library response. The measures implemented, though unplanned and developed on-the-go, constituted a behavioural change model (BCM). COVID-19 has had a positive-negative impact on library people, place, product and services and has created a new normal for Jamaican academic libraries. Research limitations/implications This paper captures the preliminary response of Jamaican academic libraries to the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on library people, place, product and services. As such, a follow-up survey on changes, challenges, strengths, impact, lessons and plans would be a useful complement to this paper. As COVID-19 information is rapidly evolving, this preliminary response of Jamaica is neither the final nor complete response to the pandemic. Practical implications The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed a gap in the literature on disaster management generally and pandemic management in particular, and on the management of health disasters in academic libraries; this paper seeks to fill this gap, albeit incrementally, through Jamaica's preliminary response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Originality/value This paper gives voice to the Caribbean academic library's COVID-19 experience, through the voice of Jamaica. It is the first scholarly paper on the impact of COVID-19 on university libraries in the Jamaican / English-speaking Caribbean, and so presents the elements of the BCM implemented by Jamaica, which provides an important guide to Caribbean academic library leaders.

Pediatric practices are the primary point of contact regarding questions about risk factors, symptoms and suspicion of illness. The lockdown could have a severe impact on overall number of consultancies, preventive medical check-ups and vaccinations. Objective The impact of COVID-19-related lockdowns in Saarland regarding patient care in the ambulatory pediatric setting and general consultation, early preventive consultancy as well as specialized medical care. Material and methods All 53 pediatric practices in Saarland were asked to report their case numbers for calendar weeks 2-26 in 2019 and 2020. These data were analyzed via descriptive statistics. Results Data from 34 (64%) of Saarland's pediatric practices were evaluated. There was a decline of -37% regarding overall cases during lockdown, -9.4% of early diagnosis cases and -35% regarding specialized medical consultancy (4 specialized practices). After lockdown the overall case numbers were significantly reduced with -17.1% in comparison to 2019, the early diagnosis cases caught up nearly completely with +9.4% and also the specialized care showed catch-up effects with +7%. Conclusion Lockdown-related collateral damage regarding preventive performances/activities could be avoided in the ambulatory pediatric setting in Saarland.

Our study adds to this literature by utilizing an intersectionality framework to examine the joint influence of race and sex on H1N1 vaccination beliefs and behaviors among non-Hispanic blacks and non-Hispanic whites (hereafter blacks and whites). Methods: Using data from the National H1N1 Flu Survey of U.S. adults, we measured differences in beliefs about the safety and efficacy of the H1N1 vaccine among black women, black men, white women, and white men. We then estimated a series of nested logistic regression models to examine how race/sex vaccination disparities were influenced by health beliefs, socioeconomic status (SES), pre-existing conditions, and healthcare. Results: Black respondents were more likely than white respondents to express reservations about the safety and efficacy of the H1N1 vaccine. Consistent with those beliefs, white females reported the highest rate of H1N1 vaccination (28.4%), followed by white males (26.3%), black males (21.6%), and black females (17.5%). Differences in health beliefs, SES, pre-existing conditions, and healthcare explained lower odds of H1N1 vaccination among white men and black men, relative to white women. However, black women experienced 35-45% lower odds of vaccination than white women across all models, highlighting the intersectional nature of these associations. Discussion: The 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic provides a cautionary tale about the distribution of new vaccines across large populations with diverse racial, sex, and socioeconomic characteristics. Despite differences between the H1N1 and COVID-19 pandemics, our study warns that many black Americans will forego COVID-19 vaccines unless swift action is taken to address black-white disparities in access to vital resources. Public health stakeholders can also encourage widespread adoption of COVID-19 vaccines by tailoring health promotion messages for different groups of racial minorities, especially groups like black women who face intersecting disadvantages.

Methodology: This was an online, questionnaire-based cross-sectional study included a questionnaire that was prepared using an online questionnaire. The questionnaire was disseminated by social media platforms to be filled by the public in January 2021. Results: Most of the respondents were females (78.00%) and the age of the majority of them was less than 25 years old. Most of the respondents were aware of COVID-19 symptoms (94%), Aware of COVID-19 severity (91%), Aware of COVID-19 risk and negative outcomes (70%) and aware of vaccination necessity (68%). Only 37 % of them agreed that COVID-19 vaccination is effective and only 32% of them agreed that the vaccine is safe. Conclusion: The study showed that there was a good acceptability of the public of COVID-19 vaccination but the respondents are worried about the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccines.

However, eradicating the disease will require a safe and efficacious vaccine. In order to prepare for the eventual development of a safe and efficacious COVID-19 vaccine and to enhance its uptake, it is imperative to assess vaccine hesitancy in Cameroonians. After obtaining ethical clearance from the Institutional Review Board of the University of Buea, a questionnaire was administered (May-August 2020) to consenting adults either online or in person. A qualitative thematic analysis was done to analyze the participants' answers to the open questions. A deductive approach was used, that is, the codes and patterns according to the World Health Organization (WHO) Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) Working Group Matrix of Determinants of vaccine hesitancy. The number of consenting adult Cameroonians who completed the questionnaire were 2512 (Two thousand five hundred and twelve). Vaccine hesitancy to a COVID-19 vaccine was 84.6% in Cameroonians. Using the WHO recommended Matrix of Determinant of Vaccine hesitancy, the most prominent determinants observed in this study were: Communication and Media Environment, Perception of pharmaceutical industry, Reliability and/or source of vaccine and cost. Most Cameroonians agree that even though there are benefits of a clinical trial, they will prefer it should be done out of the continent and involving African scientists for eventual acceptance and uptake. The concerns of safety, efficacy and confidence has to be addressed using a Public Engagement approach if a COVID-19 vaccine has to be administered successfully in Africa or Cameroon specifically.

Great Promises and Unknown Challenges Still to Come,VACCINES,"While the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic continues to strike and collect its death toll throughout the globe, as of 31 January 2021, the vaccine candidates worldwide were 292, of which 70 were in clinical testing. Several vaccines have been approved worldwide, and in particular, three have been so far authorized for use in the EU. Vaccination can be, in fact, an efficient way to mitigate the devastating effect of the pandemic and offer protection to some vulnerable strata of the population (i.e., the elderly) and reduce the social and economic burden of the current crisis. Regardless, a question is still open: after vaccination availability for the public, will vaccination campaigns be effective in reaching all the strata and a sufficient number of people in order to guarantee herd immunity? In other words: after we have it, will we be able to use it? Following the trends in vaccine hesitancy in recent years, there is a growing distrust of COVID-19 vaccinations. In addition, the online context and competition between pro- and anti-vaxxers show a trend in which anti-vaccination movements tend to capture the attention of those who are hesitant.

It is likely that the antecedents of general COVID-19-related skepticism substantially overlap with the antecedents of climate change skepticism. Additionally, skepticism about a potential vaccine in particular will likely be fueled by similar worries and misperceptions to those shaping more general antivaccination attitudes, of which conspiracy thinking is particularly worth highlighting.

Vaccine acceptance among the general public and healthcare workers appears to have a decisive role in the successful control of the pandemic. The aim of this review was to provide an up-to-date assessment of COVID-19 vaccination acceptance rates worldwide. A systematic search of the peer-reviewed English survey literature indexed in PubMed was done on 25 December 2020. Results from 31 peer-reviewed published studies met the inclusion criteria and formed the basis for the final COVID-19 vaccine acceptance estimates. Survey studies on COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rates were found from 33 different countries. Among adults representing the general public, the highest COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rates were found in Ecuador (97.0%), Malaysia (94.3%), Indonesia (93.3%) and China (91.3%). However, the lowest COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rates were found in Kuwait (23.6%), Jordan (28.4%), Italy (53.7), Russia (54.9%), Poland (56.3%), US (56.9%), and France (58.9%). Only eight surveys among healthcare workers (doctors and nurses) were found, with vaccine acceptance rates ranging from 27.7% in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to 78.1% in Israel.

In the absence of a vaccine, control of the virus involved limiting its spread through restrictions in the movement of people, goods and services. This has led to unprecedented impacts on labour availability, provision of goods and services, value chains, and markets. Objective: Against the backdrop of COVID-19 control measures, this article summarises quantitative and qualitative assessments of the impacts, adaptations, and opportunities to increase the resilience of the agricultural systems in Australia and New Zealand. Methods: Using both survey and interview methodologies, we describe the various agri-food systems and the impacts of the COVID-19 control measures across different industries, and discuss the results applying a resilience framework. Results: As essential services, all agricultural activities except for fibre production have been permitted to continue during quarantine periods but have been exposed to the major flow-on effects of movement control. We found that, to June 2020, the impacts of the COVID-19 control measures on the agri-food sectors in both Australia and New Zealand have been relatively small and that this has been due to the high levels of resilience in the agricultural systems and the people running them. Conclusions: We consider agri-food systems to be comprised of multiple subsystems with varying vulnerability to external influences. Agri-food systems were resilient to June 2020 at least, and that resilience was achieved via one or more subsystems that were able to compensate for the more vulnerable subsystems. We contrast the resilience of industries that have high plasticity (that can have a flow of material that can safely vary in time) to more rigid industries that are dependent on a steady flow of material with little or no storage. Ultimately both types of industries were resilient, but they achieved that resilience via compensating subsystems. High plasticity industries relied on their production and processing subsystem; rigid industries engaged their institutional subsystem to achieve the same end. The social and cultural subsystem was important across all industries. Significance: It is not yet clear if the current resilience mechanisms can persist under the continued onslaught of the virus. We indicate the need to capture longer term effects and analysis during the more sustained effects of the virus and through a recovery period.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of an anonymous survey sent via text message link to personal cell phones and emails. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Nursing home and assisted living facility staff in Indiana. MEASURES: Staff characteristics including age, gender, race, ethnicity, role in the facility, experience in long-term care, and geographic location of facility were self-reported along with prior infection and willingness to receive an approved vaccine as soon as it is available. Responses were weighted to represent staff statewide. Weighted frequencies and logit regression estimated characteristics associated with vaccine willingness. RESULTS: There were 8,243 responses to the survey. For nursing home staff (survey delivered via 23,232 working phone numbers), there was a 33% response rate). There were 2,372 (29%) in nurse aide or similar roles and 1,602 nurses providing direct clinical care (19%). Overall, 45% of respondents indicated they would receive an approved COVID-19 vaccine as soon as available. Of those unwilling to take the vaccine when first available, 44% would consider in the future. Concerns about side effects was the primary reason for vaccine hesitancy (70%).

It has led to more than 50 million confirmed cases and more than 1 million deaths across 219 countries as of 11 November 2020, according to WHO statistics. SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV are similar. They are highly pathogenic and threaten public health, impair the economy, and inflict long-term impacts on society. No drug or vaccine has been approved as a treatment for these viruses. Efforts to develop antiviral measures have been hampered by the insufficient understanding of how the human body responds to viral infections at the cellular and molecular levels.ResultsIn this study, journal articles and transcriptomic and proteomic data surveying coronavirus infections were collected.

However, the scale and the complexity of the sc datasets poses a great challenge in its utility and this problem is further exacerbated when working with larger datasets typically generated by consortium efforts. As the scale of single cell datasets continues to increase exponentially, there is an unmet technological need to develop database platforms that can evaluate key biological hypotheses by querying extensive single-cell datasets. Large single-cell datasets like Human Cell Atlas and COVID-19 cell atlas (collection of annotated sc datasets from various human organs) are excellent resources for profiling target genes involved in human diseases and disorders ranging from oncology, auto-immunity, as well as infectious diseases like COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus. SARS-CoV-2 infections have led to a worldwide pandemic with massive loss of lives, infections exceeding 7 million cases. The virus uses ACE2 and TMPRSS2 as key viral entry associated proteins expressed in human cells for infections. Evaluating the expression profile of key genes in large single-cell datasets can facilitate testing for diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccine targets, as the world struggles to cope with the on-going spread of COVID-19 infections. Main body: In this manuscript we describe REVEAL: SingleCell, which enables storage, retrieval, and rapid query of single-cell datasets inclusive of millions of cells. The array native database described here enables selecting and analyzing cells across multiple studies. Cells can be selected using individual metadata tags, more complex hierarchical ontology filtering, and gene expression threshold ranges, including co-expression of multiple genes. The tags on selected cells can be further evaluated for testing biological hypotheses. One such example includes identifying the most prevalent cell type annotation tag on returned cells. We used REVEAL: SingleCell to evaluate the expression of key SARS-CoV-2 entry associated genes, and queried the current database (2.2 Million cells, 32 projects) to obtain the results in < 60 s. We highlighted cells expressing COVID-19 associated genes are expressed on multiple tissue types, thus in part explains the multi-organ involvement in infected patients observed worldwide during the on-going COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion: In this paper, we introduce the REVEAL: SingleCell database that addresses immediate needs for SARS-CoV-2 research and has the potential to be used more broadly for many precision medicine applications. We used the REVEAL: SingleCell database as a reference to ask questions relevant to drug development and precision medicine regarding cell type and co-expression for genes that encode proteins necessary for SARS-CoV-2 to enter and reproduce in cells.",JAN 6,2021,22,1,,WOS:000608033700004,33407110,,,,

OBJECTIVE To estimate the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections, symptomatic infections, hospitalizations, and deaths in the US as of November 15, 2020. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this cross-sectional study of respondents of all ages, data from 4 regional and 1 nationwide Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) seroprevalence surveys (April [n = 16 596], May, June, and July [n = 40 817], and August [n = 38 355]) were used to estimate infection underreporting multipliers and symptomatic underreporting multipliers. Community serosurvey data from randomly selected members of the general population were also used to validate the underreporting multipliers. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES SARS-CoV-2 infections, symptomatic infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. The median of underreporting multipliers derived from the 5 CDC seroprevalence surveys in the 10 states that participated in 2 or more surveys were applied to surveillance data of reported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases for 5 respective time periods to derive estimates of SARS-CoV-2 infections and symptomatic infections, which were summed to estimate SARS-CoV-2 infections and symptomatic infections in the US. Estimates of infections and symptomatic infections were combined with estimates of the hospitalization ratio and fatality ratio to derive estimates of SARS-CoV-2 hospitalizations and deaths. External validity of the surveys was evaluated with the April CDC survey by comparing results to 5 serosurveys (n = 22 118) that used random sampling of the general population. Internal validity of the multipliers from the 10 specific states was assessed in the August CDC survey by comparing multipliers from the 10 states to all states. A sensitivity analysis was conducted using the interquartile range of the multipliers to derive a high and low estimate of SARS-CoV-2 infections and symptomatic infections. The underreporting multipliers were then used to adjust the reported COVID-19 infections to estimate the full SARS-COV-2 disease burden. RESULTS Adjusting reported COVID-19 infections using underreporting multipliers derived from CDC seroprevalence studies in April (n = 16 596), May (n = 14 291), June (n = 14 159), July (n = 12 367), and August (n = 38 355), there were estimated medians of 46 910 006 (interquartile range [IQR], 38 192 705-60 814 748) SARS-CoV-2 infections, 28 122 752 (IQR, 23 014 957-36 438 592) symptomatic infections, 956 174 (IQR, 782 509-1 238 912) hospitalizations, and 304 915 (IQR, 248 253-395 296) deaths in the US through November 15, 2020. An estimated 14.3% (IQR, 11.6%-18.5%) of the US population were infected by SARS-CoV-2 as of mid-November 2020. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The SARS-CoV-2 disease burden may be much larger than reported COVID-19 cases owing to underreporting. Even after adjusting for underreporting, a substantial gap remains between the estimated proportion of the population infected and the proportion infected required to reach herd immunity. Additional seroprevalence surveys are needed to monitor the pandemic, including after the introduction of safe and efficacious vaccines. This cross-sectional study assesses the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease burden in the US, using surveillance data and seroprevalence surveys to estimate the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections, symptomatic infections, hospitalizations, and deaths through November 15, 2020.",JAN 5,2021,4,1,,WOS:000610371800006,33399860,,,,

However, little is known about what Americans think of getting immunized with a COVID-19 vaccine. Thus, the purpose of this study was to conduct a comprehensive and systematic national assessment of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in a community-based sample of the American adult population. A multi-item valid and reliable questionnaire was deployed online via mTurk and social media sites to recruit U.S. adults from the general population. A total of 1878 individuals participated in the study where the majority were: females (52%), Whites (74%), non-Hispanic (81%), married (56%), employed full time (68%), and with a bachelor's degree or higher (77%). The likelihood of getting a COVID-19 immunization in the study population was: very likely (52%), somewhat likely (27%), not likely (15%), definitely not (7%), with individuals who had lower education, income, or perceived threat of getting infected being more likely to report that they were not likely/definitely not going to get COVID-19 vaccine (i.e., vaccine hesitancy). In unadjusted group comparisons, compared to their counterparts, vaccine hesitancy was higher among African-Americans (34%), Hispanics (29%), those who had children at home (25%), rural dwellers (29%), people in the northeastern U.S. (25%), and those who identified as Republicans (29%). In multiple regression analyses, vaccine hesitancy was predicted significantly by sex, education, employment, income, having children at home, political affiliation, and the perceived threat of getting infected with COVID-19 in the next 1 year. Given the high prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, evidence-based communication, mass media strategies, and policy measures will have to be implemented across the U.S. to convert vaccines into vaccinations and mass immunization with special attention to the groups identified in this study.",APR,2021,46,2,JAN 2021,WOS:000604455000001,33389421,,,,

While the economic downturn in Indonesia has been modest compared with downturns in peer countries, Indonesia's handling of the pandemic has been lacking. Almost a year into the pandemic, the country was still struggling with the first wave of infection as the number of new cases reported each day continued to rise. Facing criticism over the government's handling of the pandemic, President Joko Widodo reshuffled his cabinet at the end of 2020. This Survey examines Indonesia's plans to manage a longer-than-expected recovery from the effects of the pandemic. We see that much of the labour market is adjusting to widespread loss of employment by shifting into the agricultural sector. We also see an increase in informal employment, leading to a lower unemployment rate than expected. We argue that the pandemic has exacerbated Indonesia's long-standing structural problems. In addition to responding to the immediate crisis issues, the government must start addressing medium-term challenges and seizing reform opportunities. We discuss the existing recovery policies, including the vaccination strategy and the omnibus law on job creation. We argue that the omnibus law alone is necessary but will not be enough to improve the investment climate and create jobs for economy recovery and long-term structural transformation.",JAN 2,2021,57,1,,WOS:000641308900001,,,,,

This study aims to assess the knowledge level of individuals aged 65 years and above at a nursing home who are in the risk group for pneumococcal and influenza vaccines along with their attitudes and behaviours regarding immunisation. Materials and Methods: The questionnaire prepared by the researcher was administered to the elderly residents aged 65 years and above who could perform their own self-care in the blocks designated for healthy residents at the Narlidere Nursing Home Elderly Care and Rehabilitation Center after obtaining their oral consent. Results: The average age of the 708 elderly residents who participated in the research was 79.05 +/- 7.32 years (range 62-98), and 63% were female. Of the residents, 75.1% had heard about the pneumococcal vaccine, and 97.2% were aware of the influenza vaccine. Only 24.6% had been administered the pneumococcal vaccine, and 29.9% expressed that they did not receive it because their physician did not recommend it. A significant relation was found between having received the pneumococcal vaccine and age group (p = 0.046) and having received the pneumococcal vaccine and educational background (p = 0.025). Conclusion: Elderly people have more knowledge about influenza vaccine than pneumococcal vaccine. Their healthcare professionals mostly inform them about vaccinations. Therefore healthcare professionals should be trained about the pneumococcal vaccination procedures in elderly.",,2021,24,2,,WOS:000664872200019,,,,,

The overall objective of the iCARE Study is to assess public awareness, attitudes, concerns and behavioural responses to COVID-19 public health policies, and their impacts, on people around the world and to link behavioural survey data with policy, mobility and case data to provide behavioural science, data-driven recommendations to governments on how to optimise current policy strategies to reduce the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods and analyses The iCARE study (www.icarestudy.com) uses a multiple cross-sectional survey design to capture self-reported information on a variety of COVID-19 related variables from individuals around the globe. Survey data are captured using two data capture methods: convenience and representative sampling. These data are then linked to open access data for policies, cases and population movement.

Study population in vaccine trials is built up with healthy volunteers that should be carefully and fairly selected; as far as vaccine for emergency use are approved, the use of placebo in controlled studies raises ethical questions that should be discussed. Participants in vaccine trials should in any case be unduly influenced by any form of payment, and the gratuity of their act should be stressed in the communication and consent process. Moreover, in the context of experimentation with vaccines, sensitive ethical issues can arise also from the so-called challenge studies, since they concern intentionally infecting healthy people to investigate diseases and their treatments (human challenge trials involve exposing healthy volunteers to a pathogen to learn more about the disease it causes and to test vaccines quickly).

We test this hypothesis by examining how exposure to previous epidemics affected trust in science and scientists. Building on the impressionable years hypothesis that attitudes are durably formed during the ages 18-25, we focus on individuals exposed to epidemics in their country of residence at this particular stage of the life course. Combining data from a 2018 Wellcome Trust survey of more than 75,000 individuals in 138 countries with data on global epidemics since 1970, we show that such exposure has no impact on views of science as an endeavor but that it significantly reduces trust in scientists and in the benefits of their work. We also illustrate that the decline in trust is driven by the individuals with little previous training in science subjects. Finally, our evidence suggests that epidemic-induced distrust translates into lower compliance with health related policies in the form of negative views towards vaccines and lower rates of child vaccination.

We aimed to determine the impact of COVID-19 containment measures on the daily life and follow up of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Methods During May 2020, we evaluated 179 (79.6%) patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and 46 (20.4%) with ulcerative colitis (UC) by telephone, using a structured questionnaire to gather information on social impact and IBD follow up. Results Some kind of social distancing measure was reported by 95.6% of our patients, self-quarantine (64.9%) being the most frequent. Depressive mood was the most prevalent social impact ( 80.2%), followed by anxiety/fear of death (58.2%), insomnia (51.4%), daily activity impairment (48%), sexual dysfunction (46.2%), and productivity impairment (44%). The results were similar when we compared patients with active disease to those in remission and patients with UC to those with CD. Analysis of IBD follow up showed that 83.1% of all patients missed an IBD medical appointment, 45.5% of the patients missed laboratory tests, 41.3% missed the national flu vaccination program, 31.3% missed any radiologic exam, 17.3% missed colonoscopy, and 16.9% failed to obtain biologic therapy prescriptions.

Because of this, the economic downturn is also seen as an opportunity to speed up the sustainability transition or, in simple terms, to achieve a green recovery. What can we expect from a green recovery? We address this question by reviewing position documents in the debate between green recovery and its opponent, quick rebound, in the Netherlands. We apply systems thinking to model causal arguments regarding key concepts comprising green recovery and identify issues of consensus and dissensus. Our findings indicate that green recovery is promising for curbing greenhouse gas emissions and addressing growing socioeconomic inequalities. However, the position of what green recovery means for economic growth, including the development of gross domestic product and employment, is still largely unclear and at times contradictory.

However, the fragile hero's or health care worker's attitude toward the vaccine is of paramount importance to promote its acceptance. So, the current review aims to provide the latest assessment of healthcare workers' attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccination and its contributing factor worldwide. Methods: Peer-reviewed surveys in English indexed via an electronic database in Google Scholar, Science Direct and PubMed were systematically searched. The review was carried out per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA2009) and registered on PROSPERO (CRD42021265534). Results: Originally 8039 articles were searched from three databases PubMed, Science direct, and Google scholar. Finally, 24 studies met the inclusion criteria and made the root for the estimates of the attitude of COVID-19 vaccinations. In about two-thirds of the studies, respondents showed a positive attitude (>= 50%) toward COVID-19 vaccination. However, in about one-quarter of the studies, a negative attitude (<50%) against vaccination was reported. Factors related to the attitude of healthcare workers toward COVID-19 vaccination include age, sex, profession, concerns about the safety of vaccines and fear of COVID-19, trust in the accuracy of the measures taken by the government, flu vaccination during the previous season, comorbid chronic illness, history of recommendation, and depression symptoms in the past week. Conclusion: Although most studies report that healthcare workers have a positive attitude toward COVID-19 vaccination, quite a few surveys mention negative attitudes towards the use of vaccines, which may reflect missed opportunities or challenges for the international efforts aimed at mitigating the pandemic. Still, we need to continue to make more efforts to change the attitudes of the uncertain healthcare workers to increase the uptake of the vaccine and deal with the multi-faceted impact of infection.",,2021,14,,,WOS:000701168600009,34584432,,,,

It contrasts Lyotard's notion of the differend with Habermas's of consensus, and advances the argument that Lyotard's perspective not merely seems to be applicable to the global situation, today, but that it appears to be vindicated by the incommensurability of opinions, views and beliefs characterising the informational and communicational exchange in contemporary media on various aspects of the pandemic. The latter include the question of the origin of the novel coronavirus (natural, zoonotic transfer to humans, or technoscientifically produced in a laboratory); the issue of so-called PCR-tests (reliable or not); whether to lockdown or not (Sweden versus the rest of the world); and perhaps the most vexing question of them all, namely, whether to receive a Covid-19 vaccine or not (one of several available ones), or to depend on alternative available treatments such as Ivermectin, when necessary.

We report a case of a patient who fully recovered from COVID-19 with intermittent negative RT-PCR testing and a symptom free interval who went on to develop a second infection. The patient's second infection resulted in a more severe clinical course. The patient developed Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome resulting in intubation twice and an extensive stay in the intensive care unit. Six weeks post-discharge, the patient was evaluated for continued dyspnea, hypoxia, and continued oxygen dependence. The patient subsequently underwent right heart catherization for further evaluation and was found to have newly developed pulmonary hypertension. Given the possibility of second wave infections this fall and winter, this case highlights the concern that re-infections with COVID-19 could cause substantially worse clinical outcomes and long-term complications. In terms of ongoing vaccine development, the short lived immune response in this case calls into question the ability of a future vaccine to provide long term lasting immunity against COVID-19.",,2021,33,,,WOS:000679392700001,33312856,,,,

We estimate PHC expenditure for each low-income and middle-income country between 2000 and 2017 and test which health outputs and outcomes were associated with PHC expenditure. Methods We used three data sources to estimate PHC expenditures: recently published health expenditure estimates for each low-income and middle-income country, which were constructed using 1662 country-reported National Health Accounts; proprietary data from IQVIA to estimate expenditure of prescribed pharmaceuticals for PHC; and household surveys and costing estimates to estimate inpatient vaginal delivery expenditures. We employed regression analyses to measure the association between PHC expenditures and 15 health outcomes and intermediate health outputs. Results PHC expenditures in low-income and middle-income countries increased between 2000 and 2017, from $41 per capita (95% uncertainty interval $33-$49) to $90 ($73-$105). Expenditures for low-income countries plateaued since 2014 at $17 per capita ($15-$19). As national income increased, the proportion of health expenditures on PHC generally decrease; however, the fraction of PHC expenditures spent via ambulatory care providers grew. Increases in the fraction of health expenditures on PHC was associated with lower maternal mortality rate (p value <= 0.001), improved coverage of antenatal care visits (p value <= 0.001), measles vaccination (p value <= 0.001) and an increase in the Health Access and Quality index (p value <= 0.05). PHC expenditure was not systematically associated with all-age mortality, communicable and non-communicable disease (NCD) burden. Conclusion PHC expenditures were associated with maternal and child health but were not associated with reduction in health burden for other key causes of disability, such as NCDs. To combat changing disease burdens, policy-makers and health professionals need to adapt primary healthcare to ensure continued impact on emerging health challenges.",,2021,6,8,,WOS:000685908000001,34385159,,,,

It's the most important and cost-effective public health intervention to reduce child mortality and morbidity. Ethiopian national full vaccination coverage is 43%. This research aimed to assess full vaccination coverage and associated factors among 12-to-23-month children at Assosa Town. Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among children aged of 12 to 23 months from November to December 2020. Assosa town has two woredas. Each woreda has five kebeles. By using lottery method, five kebeles were selected from two woredas. Systematic sampling technique was used for sampling. The total sample size was 372. It was calculated by the proportionate allocation method. Questioners were used to collect data by the observation of vaccination caring and mother interviewing. Data were entered into SPSS and analyzed. Multivariance analysis was used by considering a 95% confidence interval. Variables whose p-value less than 0.05 were identified as significant. Results: The respondent rate of this study was 372 (100%). Of the total respondents, 338 (90.8%) were females and 34 (9.1%) of them were males. The coverage of full, partial, and non-vaccination is 71.77%, 16.67%, and 11.56%, respectively.

We examine and provide novel insights on the key drivers and barriers towards COVID-19 vaccine uptake. Design This study involved an anonymous cross-sectional online survey circulated across the UK in September 2020. The survey was designed to include several sections to collect demographic data and responses on (1) extent of agreement regarding various statements about COVID-19 and vaccinations, (2) previous vaccination habits (eg, if they had previously declined vaccination) and (3) interest in participation in vaccine trials. Multinominal logistic models examined demographic factors that may impact vaccine uptake. We used principle component analysis and text mining to explore perception related to vaccine uptake. Setting The survey was circulated through various media, including posts on social media networks (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Instagram), national radio, news articles, Clinical Research Network website and newsletter, and through 150 West Midlands general practices via a text messaging service. Participants There were a total of 4884 respondents of which 9.44% were black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) group. The majority were women (n=3416, 69.9%) and of white ethnicity (n=4127, 84.5%). Results Regarding respondents, overall, 3873 (79.3%) were interested in taking approved COVID-19 vaccines, while 677 (13.9%) were unsure, and 334 (6.8%) would not take a vaccine. Participants aged over 70 years old (OR=4.63) and the BAME community (OR=5.48) were more likely to take an approved vaccine. Smokers (OR=0.45) and respondents with no known illness (OR=0.70) were less likely to accept approved vaccines. The study identified 16 key reasons for not accepting approved vaccines, the most common (60%) being the possibility of the COVID-19 vaccine having side effects. Conclusions This study provides an insight into focusing on specific populations to reduce vaccine hesitancy.

This study aimed to report the trend in response to willingness to accept the COVID-19 vaccine between two waves of the local epidemic and examine differences among occupations. Two cross-sectional surveys were conducted online during the first wave (February) and third wave (August to September) of the local epidemic in 2020. Acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine was measured along with personal protection behaviours and occupations. A total of 2047 participants provided valid responses. The willingness to accept the COVID-19 vaccine among the participants was lower in the third wave (34.8%) than the first wave (44.2%). There were more concerns over vaccine safety in the third wave. Clerical/service/sales workers were less likely to accept the vaccine (adjusted odds ratio: 0.62, 95% confidence interval: 0.43-0.91). A high-level compliance of facemask wearing was found, and more people maintained social distancing and used alcohol hand rub in the third wave. Decreasing willingness to accept the COVID-19 vaccine may be associated with increasing concerns about vaccine safety and growing compliance of personal protection behaviours.

However, once vaccine production starts, it will probably take time before there is enough vaccine for everyone, evoking the question how to distribute it best. While present vaccination guidelines largely focus on individual-based factors, i.e. on the question to whom vaccines should be provided first, e.g. to risk groups or to individuals with a strong social-mixing tendency, here we ask if a strategic spatiotemporal distribution of vaccines, e.g. to prioritize certain cities, can help to increase the overall survival rate of a population subject to an epidemic disease. To this end, we propose a strategy for the distribution of vaccines in time and space, which sequentially prioritizes regions with the most new cases of infection during a certain time frame and compare it with the standard practice of distributing vaccines demographically. Using a simple statistical model we find that, for a locally well-mixed population, the proposed strategy strongly reduces the number of deaths (by about a factor of two for basic reproduction numbers of R0 similar to 1.5-4 and by about 35% for R0 similar to 1). The proposed vaccine distribution strategy establishes the idea that prioritizing individuals not only regarding individual factors, such as their risk of spreading the disease, but also according to the region in which they live can help saving lives. The suggested vaccine distribution strategy can be tested in more detailed models in the future and might inspire discussions regarding the importance of spatiotemporal distribution rules for vaccination guidelines.",DEC 9,2020,10,1,,WOS:000608956800018,33299029,,,,

Methods A cross-sectional study design was used to estimate the point seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using a rapid immunoglobulin (Ig)M-IgG combined point-of-care lateral flow immunoassay among frontline firefighters/paramedics collected over a 2-day period, 16-17 April 2020. Fire department personnel were emailed a survey link assessing COVID-19 symptoms and work exposures the day prior to the scheduled drive-through antibody testing at a designated fire station. Off-duty and on-duty firefighter/paramedic personnel drove through the fire station/training facility in their personal vehicles or on-duty engine/rescue trucks for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing. Results Among the 203 firefighters/paramedics that make up the fire department workforce, 18 firefighters/paramedics (8.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, of which 8 firefighters/paramedics (3.9%) were IgG positive only, 8 (3.9%) were IgM positive only and 2 (0.1%) were IgG/IgM positive. The positive predictive value (PPV) of the serological test is estimated to be 33.2% and the negative predictive value is 99.3%. The average number of COVID-19 case contacts (ie, within 6 feet of an infected person (laboratory-confirmed or probable COVID-19 patient) for >= 15 min) experienced by firefighters/paramedics was higher for those with positive serology compared with those with negative (13.3 cases vs 7.31 cases; p=0.022).

Thus, the aim of this study was to examine university students' knowledge, attitudes, and mental health status during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. Methods: On February 10, 2020 and during the second week of national lockdown, 511 students from a university in China were assessed using the COVID-19 General Information Questionnaire and the Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90) questionnaire. To understand the mental health status of the current sample, we compared it with the normal population. Results: Four hundred and seventy-two valid questionnaires were collected. In total, 11% of respondents reported confirmed COVID-19 cases in their hometowns or communities. In view of students' knowledge about COVID-19, 56% had sufficient knowledge of typical symptoms of COVID-19, and 41% knew a lot about prevention methods for the future pandemic. In terms of the risk perceptions, 57% had experienced considerable fear of this disease, and 19% perceived a high risk of becoming infected. In terms of attitudes towards the COVID-19 pandemic, 63% felt positive about its development (i.e., it was generally under control), and 92% declared that they were willing to be vaccinated against COVID-19. The scores for somatization, obsessive-compulsive disorder, interpersonal sensitivity, anxiety, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideation, and the general severity index were significantly increased compared with the norm (p < 0.001). However, no differences in the scores for depression, hostility and psychoticism were noted (p > 0.05).

Methods: We determined SARS-CoV-2 antibody (IgG) prevalence in 1603 patients, doctors, and nurses in 65 medical institutions in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan and investigated their background factors. Antibodies (IgG) against SARS-CoV-2 were analyzed by Immunochromatographic test. Results: The 39 subjects (2.4%) were found to be IgG antibody-positive: 29 in the patient group (2.9%), 10 in the doctor/nurse group (2.0%), and 0 in the control group. After adjustment for age, sex, and the antibody prevalence in the control group, antibody prevalence was 2.7% in the patient group and 2.1% in the doctor/nurse group. There was no significant difference between the antibody-positive subjects and the antibody-negative subjects in any background factors investigated including overseas travel, contact with overseas travelers, presence/absence of infected individuals in the living area, use of trains 5 times a week or more, BCG vaccination, and use of ACE inhibitor and ARB. Conclusions: Antibody prevalence in the present survey at medical institution is higher than that in Tokyo and in Osaka measured by the government suggesting that subclinical infections are occurring more frequently than expected.

This study aimed to assess dentists' knowledge, attitude, and perception of COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia during the early outbreak period. In addition, infection control measures for dental setting were also assessed. Online questionnaire was distributed to dentists in different regions of Saudi Arabia when COVID-19 outbreak in Saudi Arabia was at its beginning. The questionnaire was assessing demographic variables, knowledge, attitude, risk perception, and preparedness towards COVID-19. Questions regarding infection control measures were also included. The correct incubation period of the virus was recognized by 43% of participants. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath were the mostly recognized symptoms for COVID-19 (98.9%, 95.5%, and 93.3% respectively). Participants in age groups >= 60, 50-59, and 20-29 years old were more likely to perceive COVID-19 as a very dangerous disease compared to 30-39 and 40-49 age groups. Dentists in Saudi Arabia showed satisfactory knowledge and positive attitude towards COVID-19.

Often however, effective vaccinations are carried out insufficiently. In March 2020, the German measles protection law was introduced to raise the level of population (herd) immunity to over 95 %. Methods: An anonymous online survey was conducted among the population on the Measles Protection Act with self-declarations on measles vaccination/illness of participants and their children and evaluation of various sanctions. Results: 1,594 adults participated. 19.3 % were affected by the law. Of these, only 77.5 % were immune to measles, 14.0 % wanted to be fully vaccinated when the law came into force, which would lead to 91.5 % immunity. Assuming that participants with unclear vaccination status or measles disease are immune, an immunity of > 95 % can be achieved. 86.4 % of the children (aged 2 to 17 years) had developed immunity. Parents' willingness to have their children vaccinated because of the sanctions provided for in the Measles Protection Act was only 0.8 %. Conclusion: The level of immunity to measles in adults and children was under 95 % in our study. The sanctions of the Measles Protection Act are a greater incentive for adults to undergo measles vaccination than for parents. Strategies to increase immunity with the target group of parents should continue to be pursued.",DEC,2020,158,,,WOS:000604317900013,33229255,,,,

Behavioral change is the only way to prevent the pandemic and overwhelmed healthcare systems until vaccines are available. We aimed to examine the psychological factors that predict staying at home during the COVID-19 pandemic and social lockdown. A total of 1980 participants in Japan completed a survey for this study from 9 to 11 May 2020, when the state of emergency covered all prefectures in the country. Self-reported behavior in terms of staying at home, the perceived severity of the pandemic, vulnerability to the pandemic, response efficacy, and self-efficacy based on protection motivation theory were assessed. Multiple regression analysis showed that perceived severity (standardized beta = 0.11, p < 0.001) and self-efficacy (standardized beta = 0.32, p < 0.001) significantly predicted greater levels of staying at home, after controlling for socio-demographics. However, perceived vulnerability and response efficacy did not. To encourage people to stay at home during the pandemic and social lockdown, increasing the perceived severity of infection by COVID-19 and self-efficacy in terms of exercising restraint with respect to going out may consequently encourage people to stay at home.",DEC,2020,8,4,,WOS:000601518300001,33187368,,,,

Mask wearing is arguably an essential component of the new normal until substantial progress is made on a vaccine. However, though evidence suggests the practice is a positive for public health and limiting the transmission of COVID-19, there is variation in attitudes toward and practices of mask wearing. Specifically, there appears to be a sex-based divide in mask wearing, with men more likely to resist wearing masks.

Many studies successfully applied machine learning to fight COVID-19 pandemic from a different perspective. To the best of the authors' knowledge, no comprehensive survey with bibliometric analysis has been conducted yet on the adoption of machine learning to fight COVID-19. Therefore, the main goal of this study is to bridge this gap by carrying out an in-depth survey with bibliometric analysis on the adoption of machine learning-based technologies to fight COVID-19 pandemic from a different perspective, including an extensive systematic literature review and bibliometric analysis. Methods: We applied a literature survey methodology to retrieved data from academic databases and subsequently employed a bibliometric technique to analyze the accessed records. Besides, the concise summary, sources of COVID-19 datasets, taxonomy, synthesis and analysis are presented in this study. It was found that the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is mainly utilized in developing COVID-19 diagnosis and prognosis tools, mostly from chest X-ray and chest CT scan images. Similarly, in this study, we performed a bibliometric analysis of machine learning-based COVID-19 related publications in the Scopus and Web of Science citation indexes. Finally, we propose a new perspective for solving the challenges identified as direction for future research. We believe the survey with bibliometric analysis can help researchers easily detect areas that require further development and identify potential collaborators. Results: The findings of the analysis presented in this article reveal that machine learning-based COVID-19 diagnose tools received the most considerable attention from researchers. Specifically, the analyses of results show that energy and resources are more dispenses towards COVID-19 automated diagnose tools while COVID-19 drugs and vaccine development remains grossly underexploited. Besides, the machine learning-based algorithm that is predominantly utilized by researchers in developing the diagnostic tool is CNN mainly from X-rays and CT scan images. Conclusions: The challenges hindering practical work on the application of machine learning-based technologies to fight COVID-19 and new perspective to solve the identified problems are presented in this article. Furthermore, we believed that the presented survey with bibliometric analysis could make it easier for researchers to identify areas that need further development and possibly identify potential collaborators at author, country and institutional level, with the overall aim of furthering research in the focused area of machine learning application to disease control.",NOV 23,2020,,,,WOS:000591935700001,33816964,,,,

So far, little is known about what effect the pandemic, quarantine measures, and reductions in medical services had on people with cognitive impairment and their caregivers. Objectives: To develop two versions (i.e., patients and informants/caregivers) of a survey designed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic during the first Italian lockdown period (11 March -4 May 2020) on Memory Clinic outpatients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or dementia, and their caregivers. Design: Psychiatrists, neuropsychologists, and epidemiologists developed two versions: one for patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment and other cognitive disorders, the other for their relatives and/or caregivers. Each version of the survey includes five sections: (a) socio-demographic information and access to technology devices; (b) individual COVID-19 protection methods; (c) knowledge about COVID-19; (d) the effect of COVID-19 on daily life; and (e) the effect of COVID-19 on emotional state. Conclusion: Until an effective vaccine is developed it is likely that future waves of COVID-19 will result in shielding of vulnerable older adults.

Moreover, influenza-related respiratory illnesses may increase the risk of adverse outcomes of COVID-19. Thus, this study examines the mechanisms involved in influenza vaccination uptake. Specifically, this study investigates how health information sources are associated with perceived vaccine efficacy and safety, which, in turn, associated with influenza vaccine uptake. Analyzing cross-sectional survey data from a national U.S. adult sample (N = 19,420), mediation analyses were conducted. Results revealed that considering vaccine efficacy, health information seekers who assigned more value to medical professionals, medical journals, and newspaper articles were more likely to perceive a vaccine as effective, thus being more likely to receive the influenza vaccine. By contrast, individuals who placed more value in social media were less likely to perceive vaccine efficacy, and, in turn, were less likely to get the influenza vaccine. Turning to vaccine safety, the value ascribed to medical professionals was positively associated with vaccine safety, which, in turn, related to influenza vaccine uptake. By contrast, social media, family or friends, and promotions were negatively associated with vaccine safety, and then influenza vaccine uptake.",SEP 1,2020,25,9,NOV 2020,WOS:000589107100001,33186091,,,,

This relies on individuals' adoption of protective behaviors, their perceived risk, and the use and trust of information sources. During a health emergency, receiving timely and accurate information enables individuals to take appropriate actions to protect themselves, shaping their risk perception. Italy was the first western country plagued by COVID-19 and one of the most affected in the early phase. During this period, we surveyed 2,223 Italians before the national lockdown. A quarter of the sample perceived COVID-19 less threatening than flu and would not vaccinate, if a vaccine was available. Besides, most people perceived containment measures, based on social distancing or wearing masks, not useful. This perceived utility was related to COVID-19 threat perception and efficacy beliefs. All these measures were associated with the use of media and their truthfulness: participants declared to mainly use the Internet, while health organizations' websites were the most trusted. Although social networks were frequently used, they were rated lower for trustfulness. Our data differ from those obtained in other community samples, suggesting the relevance to explore changes across different countries and during the different phases of the pandemic.

With no vaccine available, the public is advised to practice non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) including social distancing, mask-wearing, and washing hands. However, little is known about public perceptions of the effectiveness of these measures, and high perceived effectiveness is likely to be critical in order to achieve widespread adoption of NPI. Methods In May 2020, we conducted a cross-sectional survey among U.S. adults (N = 3,474). The primary outcome was a six-item measure assessing perceived effectiveness of recommended behaviors to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection from 1 (not at all effective) to 5 (extremely effective). The sample was divided into higher and lower perceived effectiveness groups. Covariates included demographics, healthcare characteristics, and health beliefs. Variables that were significant at p<0.01 in bivariate analyses were entered into a multivariable logistic regression and a best-fit model was created using a cutoff of p<0.01 to stay in the model. Results Mean age was 45.5 years and most participants were non-Hispanic White (63%) and female (52.4%). The high perceived effectiveness group was slightly larger than the low perceived effectiveness group (52.7% vs. 47.3%). Almost all health belief variables were significant in the best-fit regression model. COVID-19-related worry (aOR = 1.82; 95% CI = 1.64-2.02), and perceived threat to physical health (aOR = 1.32; 95% CI = 1.20-1.45) were positively associated with perceived effectiveness while perceived severity of COVID-19 (0.84; 95% CI = 0.73-0.96) and perceived likelihood of infection (0.85; 95% CI = 0.77-0.94) switched directions in the adjusted model and were negatively associated with perceived effectiveness. Conclusions This research indicates people generally believe NPI are effective, but there was variability based on health beliefs and there are mixed rates of engagement in these behaviors. Public health efforts should focus on increasing perceived severity and threat of SARS-CoV-2-related disease, while promoting NPI as effective in reducing threat.",NOV 4,2020,15,11,,WOS:000589609300054,33147261,,,,

BCG activates monocytes and innate memory NK cells which are crucial for the antiviral immune response. Therefore, strategies to prevent COVID-19 in health workers (HW) should be carried out to prevent them becoming unwell so that they can continue to work during the pandemic. The hypothesis is that BCG will improve the innate immune response and prevent symptomatic infection or COVID-19 severity.The primary objective is to verify the effectiveness and safety of the BCG vaccine to prevent or reduce incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the city of Goiania (Brazil) among HW previously vaccinated with BCG and also its severity and mortality during the pandemic of the disease.Secondary objectives are to estimate the incidence of COVID-19 among these professionals and the innate immune response elicited to BCG. Trial design: This a phase II trial for repositioning BCG as a preventive strategy against COVID-19.The trial is an open-label, parallel-group randomised clinical trial, comparing HW vaccinated with BCG and HW not vaccinated. Participants: The trial will recruit 800 HW of Goiania - Goias, Brazil to reach a total of 400 HW included after comorbidities questioning and laboratorial evaluation. Eligibility criteria: Any HW presenting BCG vaccination scar with direct contact with suspected COVID-19 patients for at least 8 hours per week, whether in hospital beds, ICU, or in transportation or admission (nurses, doctors, physiotherapists, nutritionists, receptionists, etc.) who have negative IgM and IgG COVID-19 test.Participants with any of the following characteristics will be excluded:- - Have had in the last fifteen days any signs or symptoms of virus infection, including COVID-19; - Have had fever in the last fifteen days; - Have been vaccinated fifteen days before the inclusion; - Have a history or confirmation of any immunosuppressive disease such as HIV, presented solid tumour in the last two years or autoimmune diseases; - Are under preventive medication with antibiotics, steroid anti-inflammatories, or chemotherapy; - Have less than 500 neutrophils per mL of blood; - Have previously been diagnosed with tuberculosis; - Are breastfeeding or pregnant; - Are younger than 18 years old; - Are participating as an investigator in this clinical trial. Intervention and comparator: HW will be randomized into the BCG vaccinated group or the BCG unvaccinated control group. The BCG vaccinated group will receive in the right arm, intradermally, a one off dose of 0.1 mL corresponding to approximately 2 x10(5) to 8 x10(5) CFU of live, freeze-dried, attenuated BCG Moscow 361-I, Bacillus Calmette Guerin vaccine (Serum Institute of India PVT. LTD.). The unvaccinated control group will not be vaccinated. The HW allocated in both groups will be followed up at specific times points until 180 days post inclusion. The vaccinated and control groups will be compared according to COVID-19 related outcomes. Main outcomesThe primary outcomes are the incidence coefficient of infection by SARS-CoV-2 determined by RT-PCR of naso-oropharyngeal swab specimen or rapid lateral flow IgG and IgM test, and presence of general COVID-19 symptoms, disease severity and admission to hospital during the 180 days of follow up.The secondary outcome is the innate immune response elicited 15-20 days after vaccination. Randomisation: The vaccine vial contains approximately 10 doses. In order to optimize the vaccine use, the randomisation was performed in blocks of 20 participants using the platform randomization.com [http://www.jerrydallal.com/random/permute.htm].The randomization was prepared before any HW inclusion. The results were printed and inserted in sealed envelopes that were numbered with BCG-001 to BCG-400. The printed results as well the envelopes had the same numbers. At the time of the randomisation, each participant that meets the inclusion criteria will receive a consecutive participant number [BCG-001-BCG-400]. The sealed envelope with the assigned number, blinded to the researchers, will be opened in front of the participant and the arm allocation will be known. Blinding (masking): There is no masking for the participants or for the healthcare providers.The study will be blinded to the laboratory researchers and to those who will be evaluating the outcomes and performing the statistical analyses. In this case, only the participant identification number will be available. Numbers to be randomised (sample size): Four hundred heath workers will be randomised in two groups.

To date, no chemical treatment has proven efficient in clinical tests to combat the virus. The hope for the reopening of socioeconomic activities is found in the discovery of vaccines that can immunize people on a large scale. According to the World Health Organization, there are 29 vaccine candidates in the clinical evaluation phase and 138 candidates in the pre-clinical evaluation phase. In the race to discover a vaccine, there are initiatives from several laboratories and research centers. However, some countries stand out with a concentration of initiatives. This leads us to question whether this ability to promote research, development and seek innovation in the health field is not only associated with the size of economies, but also with the quality of the business environment. Thus, the aim of the present study is to explore the relationship between innovation and economic freedom, using econometric methodology (e.g. Panel Data Analysis) combined with non-parametric methodology (e.g., Data Envelopment Analysis).

The COVID-19 pandemic shows that the population can experience general psychological distress. The sanitary regime in dental offices and lack of vaccine for coronavirus may have an impact on the level of dental anxiety among patients undergoing oral surgery procedures. A clinical study was conducted between November 2019 and September 2020. A total of 175 patients (n = 175) were enrolled in the research. The aim of the study was to assess the attitude of patients towards the new situation related to the reduced availability of dental offices providing oral surgery procedures. The level of anxiety associated with surgical intervention was measured using a self-made COVID-19 questionnaire and the MDAS scale. The ED-5Q questionnaire and EQ-VAS scale were also used in this research. The study showed that 21.9% of respondents presented with increased anxiety about a dental visit compared with the time before the pandemic. This epidemiological situation has led to an overwhelming increase in moderate dental anxiety (M: 11.4) among patients undergoing oral surgery procedures. The quality of patients' health (EQ-VAS) related to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic and the quarantine decreased by 10 percentage points.

Evidence from previous emerging infectious disease outbreaks points to the role of perceived risk, worry, media coverage, and knowledge in shaping engagement with health-protective behaviors and vaccination intentions. The aim of the current study was to examine the role of these factors in predicting recommended health-protective behaviors early in the pandemic. A secondary aim was to assess uncertainty and misconceptions about COVID-19. An online survey of 2,174 Australian residents was completed between March 2 and 9, 2020, at an early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak in Australia. Results revealed that two-thirds of respondents were at least moderately worried about a widespread COVID-19 outbreak. Worry about the outbreak and closely following media coverage were consistent predictors of greater engagement with health-protective behaviors and higher vaccination intentions. Uncertainty and misconceptions about COVID-19 were common, including uncertainty about whether people are likely to have natural or existing immunity to the virus. There was also uncertainty around whether specific home remedies (e.g., vitamins and saline rinses) would offer protection and whether the virus was human-made and deliberately released. Such misconceptions are likely to cause concern for members of the public. The findings also highlight psychological and demographic factors associated with lower engagement with health-protective behaviors, including male gender, younger age, and low levels of worry about the outbreak. These findings offer potential pathways and targets for interventions to encourage health-protective behaviors. The results relating to uncertainty and misconceptions about COVID-19 point to areas that could be usefully targeted by public information campaigns.",SEP 30,2020,11,,,WOS:000578300100001,33117223,,,,

We undertook an online survey to measure the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for a COVID-19 vaccine and its determinants in Indonesia. The WTP was assessed using a simple dichotomous contingent valuation approach and a linear regression model was used to assess its associated determinants. There were 1,359 respondents who completed the survey. In total, 78.3% (1,065) were willing to pay for the COVID-19 vaccine with a mean and median WTP of US$ 57.20 (95%CI: US$ 54.56, US$ 59.85) and US$ 30.94 (95%CI: US$ 30.94, US$ 30.94), respectively. Being a health-care worker, having a high income, and having high perceived risk were associated with higher WTP. These findings suggest that the WTP for a COVID-19 vaccine is relatively high in Indonesia. This WTP information can be used to construct a payment model for a COVID-19 vaccine in the country.

Although in 2016 the GPEI expected to globally coordinate cessation of the remaining OPV serotypes (1 and 3) by 2021, continuing transmission of serotype 1 wild polioviruses to date makes those plans obsolete. With increasing time since the last reported polio case caused by serotype 3 wild poliovirus (in November 2012) leading to high confidence about its successful global eradication, the Global Commission for the Certification of Poliomyelitis Eradication recently certified its eradication. Questions now arise about the optimal timing of serotype 3 OPV (OPV3) cessation. Using an integrated global model that characterizes the risks, costs, and benefits of global polio policy and risk management options, we explored the implications of different options for coordinated cessation of OPV3 prior to COVID-19. Globally coordinating cessation of OPV3 as soon as possible offers the opportunity to reduce cases of vaccine-associated paralytic polio globally. In addition, earlier cessation of OPV3 should reduce the risks of creating serotype 3 circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses after OPV3 cessation, which represents a significant threat to the polio endgame given current GPEI plans to reduce preventive OPV supplemental immunization activities starting in 2019.",FEB,2021,41,2,SEP 2020,WOS:000569493100001,32936466,,,,

Question What are the safety and immunogenicity of an inactivated vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)? Findings This was an interim analysis of 2 randomized placebo-controlled trials. In 96 healthy adults in a phase 1 trial of patients randomized to aluminum hydroxide (alum) only and low, medium, and high vaccine doses on days 0, 28, and 56, 7-day adverse reactions occurred in 12.5%, 20.8%, 16.7%, and 25.0%, respectively; geometric mean titers of neutralizing antibodies at day 14 after the third injection were 316, 206 and 297 in the low-, medium-, and high-dose groups, respectively. In 224 healthy adults randomized to the medium dose, 7-day adverse reactions occurred in 6.0% and 14.3% of the participants who received injections on days 0 and 14 vs alum only, and 19.0% and 17.9% who received injections on days 0 and 21 vs alum only, respectively; geometric mean titers of neutralizing antibodies in the vaccine groups at day 14 after the second injection were 121 vs 247, respectively. Meaning This inactivated COVID-19 vaccine had a low rate of adverse reactions and demonstrated immunogenicity, but longer-term assessment of safety and efficacy will require phase 3 trials. Importance A vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is urgently needed. Objective To evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of an investigational inactivated whole-virus COVID-19 vaccine in China. Interventions In the phase 1 trial, 96 participants were assigned to 1 of the 3 dose groups (2.5, 5, and 10 mu g/dose) and an aluminum hydroxide (alum) adjuvant-only group (n = 24 in each group), and received 3 intramuscular injections at days 0, 28, and 56. In the phase 2 trial, 224 adults were randomized to 5 mu g/dose in 2 schedule groups (injections on days 0 and 14 [n = 84] vs alum only [n = 28], and days 0 and 21 [n = 84] vs alum only [n = 28]). Design, Setting, and Participants Interim analysis of ongoing randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1 and 2 clinical trials to assess an inactivated COVID-19 vaccine. The trials were conducted in Henan Province, China, among 96 (phase 1) and 224 (phase 2) healthy adults aged between 18 and 59 years. Study enrollment began on April 12, 2020. The interim analysis was conducted on June 16, 2020, and updated on July 27, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary safety outcome was the combined adverse reactions 7 days after each injection, and the primary immunogenicity outcome was neutralizing antibody response 14 days after the whole-course vaccination, which was measured by a 50% plaque reduction neutralization test against live severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Results Among 320 patients who were randomized (mean age, 42.8 years; 200 women [62.5%]), all completed the trial up to 28 days after the whole-course vaccination. The 7-day adverse reactions occurred in 3 (12.5%), 5 (20.8%), 4 (16.7%), and 6 (25.0%) patients in the alum only, low-dose, medium-dose, and high-dose groups, respectively, in the phase 1 trial; and in 5 (6.0%) and 4 (14.3%) patients who received injections on days 0 and 14 for vaccine and alum only, and 16 (19.0%) and 5 (17.9%) patients who received injections on days 0 and 21 for vaccine and alum only, respectively, in the phase 2 trial. The most common adverse reaction was injection site pain, followed by fever, which were mild and self-limiting; no serious adverse reactions were noted. The geometric mean titers of neutralizing antibodies in the low-, medium-, and high-dose groups at day 14 after 3 injections were 316 (95% CI, 218-457), 206 (95% CI, 123-343), and 297 (95% CI, 208-424), respectively, in the phase 1 trial, and were 121 (95% CI, 95-154) and 247 (95% CI, 176-345) at day 14 after 2 injections in participants receiving vaccine on days 0 and 14 and on days 0 and 21, respectively, in the phase 2 trial. There were no detectable antibody responses in all alum-only groups.

Neutralization antibody titre was determined using microneutralization assays. Potential infectivity of clinical samples was evaluated by cell inoculation. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected using three different RT-PCR kits and multiplex PCR with nanopore sequencing. Findings: Among 619 discharged COVID-19 cases, 87 re-tested as SARS-CoV-2 positive in circumstances of social isolation. All re-positive cases had mild or moderate symptoms at initial diagnosis and were younger on average (median, 28). Re-positive cases (n = 59) exhibited similar neutralization antibodies (NAbs) titre distributions to other COVID-19 cases (n = 218) tested here. No infectious strain could be obtained by culture and no full-length viral genomes could be sequenced from re-positive cases. Interpretation: Re-positive SARS-CoV-2 cases do not appear to be caused by active reinfection and were identified in similar to 14% of discharged cases.

Furthermore, knowledge about the immune status of the population is lacking. Nonetheless, these data are needed to understand the dynamics of the pandemic and hence to appropriately design and evaluate interventions. For this purpose, we recently started a prospective population-based cohort in Munich, Germany, with the aim to develop a better understanding of the state and dynamics of the pandemic.MethodsIn 100 out of 755 randomly selected constituencies, 3000 Munich households are identified via random route and offered enrollment into the study. All household members are asked to complete a baseline questionnaire and subjects >= 14years of age are asked to provide a venous blood sample of <= 3ml for the determination of SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgA status. The residual plasma and the blood pellet are preserved for later genetic and molecular biological investigations. For twelve months, each household member is asked to keep a diary of daily symptoms, whereabouts and contacts via WebApp. If symptoms suggestive for COVID-19 are reported, family members, including children <14years, are offered a pharyngeal swab taken at the Division of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, LMU University Hospital Munich, for molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2.

In response to Hooper's book, The River(1999), the Royal Society in London held a conference to debate the origins of HIV. Examination of the quick dismissal of the OPV theory opens a space for legitimately challenging the widely held belief that the vaccine contamination question was convincingly resolved. This article interrogates the relationship between historiography and the making of scientific facts and history, suggesting that historians have been too credulous of scientists' testimony. The further result of the lack of a thorough analysis of the evidence backing the OPV hypothesis has resulted in a missed opportunity to readThe Riveras one of the few detailed accounts of the immense social, political, technological, and interspecies infrastructure constituted by Cold War vaccine production.

The aim of this study was to analyze risk factors for COVID-19 prevalence and deaths in all 6 geopolitical regions and 37 States in Nigeria. Methods: we analyzed the data retrieved from various sources, including Nigeria CDC, Nigeria National Bureau of Statistics, Unicef-Nigeria multiple indicator cluster survey and the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation, University of Washington. We examined 4 clinical risk factors (prevalence of TB, HIV, smoking and BCG vaccination coverage) and 5 sociodemographic factors (age >= 65, population density, literacy rate, unemployment and GDP per capita). Multivariate modeling was conducted using generalized linear model. Results: our analysis showed that the incidence of confirmed COVID-19 cases differed widely across the 37 States, from 0.09 per 100,000 in Kogi to 83.7 in Lagos. However, more than 70% of confirmed cases were concentrated in just 7 States: Lagos, Abuja, Oyo, Kano, Edo, Rivers and Delta. Case mortality rate (CMR) also varied considerably, with Lagos, Abuja and Edo having CMR above 9 per million population. On bivariate analysis, higher CMR correlated positively with GDP (r=0.53) and to a lesser extent with TB (r=0.36) and population density (r=0.38). On multivariate analysis, which is more definitive, States with higher HIV prevalence and BCG coverage had lower CMR, while high GDP States had a greater CMR. Conclusion: this study indicates that COVID-19 has disproportionately affected certain States in Nigeria. Population susceptibility factors include higher economic development but not literacy or unemployment. Death rates were mildly lower in States with higher HIV prevalence and BCG vaccination coverage.",APR,2020,35,,,WOS:000616555000129,33193946,,,,

Lockdowns, travel restrictions, quarantines, social distancing, and other strict public health measures are playing their part in delaying the spread of infection, but a safe and potent vaccine, effective therapeutics, point-of-care diagnostics, and other health products are desperately needed because it may not be practically possible for governments to extend these measures for an indefinite period of time. On March 23, Costa Rica submitted a proposal to the Director-General of the World Health Organization for the creation of a global pooling mechanism in order to facilitate access to and use of intellectual property, trade-secret know-how, regulatory data, cell lines, product blueprints, and other proprietary data for technologies that are useful for the detection, prevention, control, and treatment of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study critically evaluates Costa Rica's proposal and endeavors to briefly answer the following questions: Why Costa Rica's proposal deserves serious consideration? To what extent this proposal addresses some of the key concerns related to the COVID-19? To what extent this proposal is practically feasible?",JAN-JUN,2020,7,1,,WOS:000612916400036,32855814,,,,

This can be largely explained by legislative initiatives that draw mixed reactions from the public, by real problems that people face during vaccinations and medical check-ups, and, certainly, by the pandemic of COVID-19. A separate group of problems connected with various preventive medical programs is composed of criminological risks and prevention of crimes associated with preventive healthcare. The authors give a definition of criminological security in the sphere of preventive medicine, single out criminological risks and present their classification. They describe the essence of key criminological risks of preventive medicine (iatrogenic and corruption ones), establish their causes and outline the ways of their prevention. To reduce the iatrogenic risks of vaccination, it is suggested that a systemic national monitoring of the safety of vaccines should be organized, including the analysis of official data, public surveys, comparison of data from various sources, and other measures. To reduce the iatrogenic risks of medical check-ups, it is necessary to reject medical examinations that pose high risks to life and health; it is also necessary for the Russian Ministry of Healthcare to issue orders with a list of medical manipulations included in check-ups which would also act as criteria of their completeness. The authors believe that corruption risks in the sphere of preventive medicine can be reduced through the following measures: 1) vaccinations and check-ups should be conducted after citizens request them in their accounts (this should reduce the number of distorted records); 2) the list of compulsory check-up procedures should not include the procedures that cause pain, are dangerous to health and life, as well as those connected with accessing closed parts of the human body, or they should be substituted with alternative procedures that provide diagnostic results; 3) a time limit for check-ups should be introduced; 4) preventive medicine should be included in the monitoring of the effectiveness of corruption counteraction. A legal and criminological expertise of draft legal acts that regulate the procedure of medical check-ups, conducted by leading legal centers (universities), should become a general measure of preventing criminological risks of medical check-ups.",,2020,14,5,,WOS:000592782800001,,,,,

G.",Contribution of antibody-dependent enhancement to the pathogenesis of coronavirus infections,AIMS ALLERGY AND IMMUNOLOGY,"Since the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in late 2019, vaccines against the COVID-19 infection have been under development using different approaches. At present, protective immunity factors against COVID-19 infection are not completely characterized. Of the four structural proteins of coronavirus, the spike protein (S) and the nucleocapsid protein (N) are most widely expressed in viral infections and elicit the antibody response. Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) presents a problem for developing a vaccine against SARS-CoV. It was shown in animal studies that SARS-CoV-1 vaccines containing recombinant S-protein or DNA-vaccine expressed S-protein led to pulmonary immunopathology after infection with SARS virus. Antibodies to the coronavirus S-protein produced by the human immune system in response to infection may contribute to the penetration of SARS-CoV into monocytes and macrophages through the Fc-gamma receptor (Fc gamma R) and may aggravate the course of infection. The demonstration of ADE with coronavirus infection raises fundamental questions regarding the development of vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the use of passive prophylaxis or treatment with virus-specific monoclonal antibodies. Evaluation of the mechanisms of immunopathology, including the responses of immunoglobulins and cytokines to vaccines, and tests for antigen-antibody complexes after infection and vaccination can help address these issues.",,2020,4,3,,WOS:000565944800001,,,,,

A.; Hafez, Ahmed A.",Aplastic anemia and COVID-19: how to break the vicious circuit?,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BLOOD RESEARCH,"Aplastic anemia (AA) is a type of anemia that is caused by an intrinsic defect of hematopoietic progenitors or an extrinsic immune mediated destruction of stem cells. Patients commonly presented with pancytopenia, particularly leukopenia that renders patient susceptible to various infections. COVID-19 is one of these infections that could be life threatening and highly contagious. Infection with COVID-19 is expected in a patient who developed fever, respiratory manifestations, leukopenia and lymphopenia together with history suggestive of exposure to infection. Furthermore COVID-19 was found associated with thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis and monocytopenia in severe cases. Thus the relationship between COVID-19 infection and AA would be a vicious circle as both cause leukopenia and lymphopenia. This study aimed to break this circle, through proposing risk stratification of vulnerability to COVID-19 in AA patients who were admitted in our institution in the period from Mar. 2018 to Mar. 2020 followed by a strict preventive plan tailored for each risk group. 79% of AA patients were at high risk of acquiring COVID-19 infection if exposed. This group of patients have to be targeted with more aggressive preventive plan than normal healthy persons. In conclusion this study proposed next step in combating COVID-19 infection through mass survey of high risk people then application of specific precautions to them, perhaps they could be candidate for future vaccine or prophylactic treatment.",,2020,10,4,,WOS:000588399500001,32923084,,,,

Patients and Methods: We conducted an analytical cross-sectional study among 23 Congolese referral hospitals, including three university hospitals, located in three towns from March through 30 April 2020. The main outcome variable was healthcare workers' acceptance of a future vaccine against COVID-19. The associated factors of vaccination willingness were identified through a logistic regression analysis. Results: A sample of 613 HCWs participated in the study and completed the study questionnaire, including 312 (50.9%) men and 301 (49.1%) women. Only 27.7% of HCWs said that they would accept a COVID-19 vaccine if it was available. From the logistic regression analysis, male healthcare workers (ORa=1.17, 95% CI: 1.15-2.60), primarily doctors (ORa=1.59; 95% CI:1.03-2.44) and having a positive attitude towards a COVID-19 vaccine (ORa=11.49; 95% CI: 5.88-22.46) were significantly associated with reporting willingness to be vaccinated. Conclusion: For acceptability of vaccination against COVID-19 among others education among HCWs is crucial because health professionals' attitudes about vaccines are an important determinant of their own vaccine uptake and their likelihood of recommending the vaccine to their patients.",,2020,11,,,WOS:000593963300001,33154695,,,,

According to the data received, the level of respondents' awareness about measures to prevent infection, as well as commitment to their implementation is high, and most of all residents of Moscow city are concerned about rapid spread of infection, lack of effective treatment and vaccine, fear for the health of parents and eventual economic destabilization in the country. At the same time, in a situation of forced staying at home in self-isolation, respondents most often experience discomfort from price increases, reducing (losing) income, limiting personal space and broken holiday plans.

1112,"Sisay, Tariku; Tolessa, Tesfaye","COVID-19 Pandemic: A Compressive Review on Gender, Herd Immunity, and Physiological Mechanisms",RISK MANAGEMENT AND HEALTHCARE POLICY,"Background: Researchers and scientists experienced the spread and aid recovery of the COVID-19 pandemic with a condition of great uncertainty. With limited understanding of SARS-CoV-2, current attempts at controlling its spread are focused on the suppressing approach (to reduce a sustained endogenous transmission) and the mitigating approach (to reduce the growth rate of the epidemic). On the one hand, while there has been no firm explanation, many governments have considered immunity passport and herd immunity for paths out of restrictive physical distancing measures imposed to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 but were not successful. Purpose of Review: Herein, we attempted to systematize the lessons and shreds of evidence related to the spectrum of illness, the physiological mechanisms of host susceptibility, herd immunity, immunity passport, gender disparities, and severe challenges and uncertainties posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. We hope that the insights provided in this review will help raise the effectiveness of the treatment policies and preventive measures required to end the pandemic. Recent Findings: The use of immunity passports is suggested to certify an individual at low risk of acquiring or transmitting SARS-CoV-2. But, an individual might nevertheless carry the virus at similar levels and for a similar duration to those previously uninfected, with an unchanged potential for transmission. Vaccine-induced herd immunity is a complex issue inherent to a vaccine and the population receiving the vaccine. The central epidemiological questions about are as follows: what proportion of the population should be vaccinated to meet elimination (in a local program), eradication (in a global program) or a defined level of control? How is this affected by demographic factors (such as gender)? What is the best age at which to immunize? Besides, although age-dependent mortality risk is estimated to be higher for men and older people, such interpretation across gender, age groups, and countries, however, must be accepted with caution at present. Summary: COVID-19 has taught us that health is the basis of global wealth and international solidarity is an essential response and a superior approach to isolationism. Hence, we must be clear about what the alternatives are when evaluating the merits of different ways of tackling this pandemic both in the short term as well as in the long term.",,2020,13,,,WOS:000603074700001,33363420,,,,

Besides the battle on the medical front-line, governments and the industry also massively explored the deployment of information and communication technologies to track and curb the spread of the virus. On the front-line of these efforts, have been the so-called Mobile Contact Tracing Applications (MCTA). These refer to mobile apps that exploit the rich ecosystem of mobile sensors (e.g., location, proximity) as well as social networks to facilitate the process of identification of persons who may have been previously into contact with a covid infected person and subsequent collection of further information about these contacts. Although MCTA can in theory help governments fight the rapid spread of diseases like COVID-19, there are important privacy considerations and many claim that these technologies will put in place a massive global surveillance infrastructure that will survive even when a vaccine for the COVID-19 disease has been found. This panel aims to discuss the major challenges and open topics surrounding MCTA.
